# Document Key
All key tags are either put in parentheses or in brackets, i'm also toying with the idea of using tags on individual headings
- N/P : Name Pending - not final name, please send suggestions
- (?) : Incomplete Idea - its an idea that I've developed and... ya'know
- S/C : stolen concept - reference for a section that needs to be rewritten to match other connected ideas
- [] : create document - a name or phrase that needs to  be expanded into its own document
- '' : research section - do some formal research and referencing to back up the contents of a section
- > : Block Quote - aesthetic nonsense, often was the inspiration for the idea or a related bit of text I wrote or found and modified 
- [[]] : a link the document with that title 
- [[#]] : a link to a heading
