### Setting 
takes place on [[Thalasia]] about 50 years pre-contact
### Plot
Protagonist is going to school and feeling othered by the system, the way he thinks is different from their class mates and partially because the experimentation that birthed him gave him a true sight ability allowing him sense the the shape and elemental composition of the things around him, this gives him an advantage when sneaking around teachers and bullies or avoiding the government that's trying to capture him all of a sudden 
the protagonist is the child of a pair of scientist researchers that where killed for trying to publicize their work, their kid is then taken and overseen by the government at a the nearest local school
turns out hes a lab baby and was one of the experiments to get their species to have psychic powers, he is not able to move things with his mind but is later given some alien tech that does give him telekinesis 
Main character dreams with his weird particle sense and can’t sense the physical shape of objects just what they are made of 

### Writing
He looked at the diagram of the sodium and chlorine atoms mapping the reaction that takes place to create salt. The electron was a small bead on a perfectly flat circle and the redox reaction was as simple as popping the bead off of the sodium’s outermost orbital and onto the chlorine atom. It was like he was looking at a picture book for a two year old. In discontent, he started systematically listing the things wrong with the diagram in his head. Atoms for one, were three dimensional, like everything else in the universe. The topology of two dimensional atoms did not work in three dimensional space. It was difficult to describe in words but each element had a distinct shape, and those shapes would fit together. The only analogy he could think of was solid things like Legos or wooden building blocks, but atoms didn’t exactly have a solid geometry, and it was more than just one atom slotting into another. They became a part of one another, a new shape that was often completely different from its components. The electron didn’t just pop off and join the other orbital, the atoms merged, the fuzzy probability of their orbitals rearranging or blending together. It was much more interesting than whatever this diagram was trying to communicate.

He knew these things because he had seen atoms before. Well “seeing” wasn’t really the best way to describe it. It was more like a sense. If he concentrated on something he could Sense the shape of these atoms that made it up. It took him a long time to figure out what he was doing, how to concentrate on the elemental shapes, and then how to move them. 

Metals were the easiest, because their bonds were symmetrical and repeated, the result felt like a continuous shape. A slab of metal was just a single unit that could easily be thrown around. Alloys were a bit harder but the repeated structure made it easier to understand. Once he got into things like glass and silicate rocks it would take a second to focus his “grip” on the material. Rock or dirt don't have repeating structures and imperfections can make it difficult focus

Wood was nearly impossible, the complex chains of carbon formed a lattice that was extremely hard to concentrate on. Several times he would try to force the concentration, dump way too much energy into the force and send the thing flipping across the room. That or it would slip from his grasp and The best he could do was a controlled hover of a paperclip sized chip of pencil for a couple of seconds. 

Living things were incomprehensible, to even look at, every time he tried he was filled with so much information that he would get knocked unconscious if he tried to concentrate. It became embarrassing when he would try and throw his teacher across the room in silent frustration, only to wake up minutes later, being scolded for sleeping in class. 

It took a while to figure out that what he was seeing when he concentrated on an object with his mind was the representation of an atom, the flat drawing of atoms were so abstract to him, they seemed to represent something that didn’t exist. He was always curious about how the world worked around him, it was the only way he was to make sense of it. It was easier to break things down into smaller pieces that he could understand then pretending like he knew what he was doing. It was on his dives into the school library when he found a science textbook that described what he was sensing. 

If he concentrated on the shape of the material, it would start to get more fuzzy and shapes of the orbitals would dissipate. It was very weird, focusing on something and watching it become more indistinguishable. If he kept at it the shape gave way to a sea of nonsense that reminded him of a pool of water and sand that someone had shaken up. Except it would never stop flowing and swirling and within seconds he would start to feel nauseous.

He closed his eyes and took a short, pained breath. Beyond the screaming from the pain in his foot he could sense the damage that had been done clearly in his mind. a torn ligament and a gash that ran from heel to his shin



he could feel the tear in space, its shape reminded him of a 4 dimensional torus, then...            

he was looking to the floor, not with his Sense but his eyes, he felt blind. He dragged his gaze up across the tiles to...

then to the cabinet, and the counter, he looked back...

He stared at the floor, eyes wide, what had he just been looking at? His mind went blank, it came up with nothing, _nothing_. He tried to form a description, anything, but his entire mind locked up as absence corrupted his concentration. He needed to get out of this room, _now_. Whatever was happening could not be seen.

If the King in Yellow had played with u and fed u for ur entire life and let you sleep in his berth of unspeakable blackness at night, and then hugged you reassuringly when Cthulhu rose from the depths, you might be able to handle it better too

I did it, I felt my destination an inch from my face and the pit in my stomach disappeared. I felt a push in a direction that I couldn't describe. A faint sense of falling, then I was there, the ten yards at the end of the parking lot 

It’s like creating a hole in the topology of the universe
