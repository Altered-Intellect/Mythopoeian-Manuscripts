on the isolated belt of rock and ice at the edge of Terran's solar system, an abandoned colony of miners turns into a dispersed but self sustaining string of settlements throughout the belt. the colony is sustained using a previously undiscovered power source, kept secret by the greedy corporations/noble houses that formed after the abandonment of the colony. The protagonist, is undercover in the high society, who wants nothing but to expand and maintain their control the small hunk of rock central to the belt and hoard its meager power and resources. The belt of debris are hit with storms that tear through the complex plane and 4d spacetime. The Storm breaches the protections put in place and tears open the capital court house killing everyone but the protagonist and one other person as they are the only one who has been through one of those storms. The remaining nobility, terrified and angry, accuse the protagonist with sabotage and they are forced to flee. the other sole survivor believes that the protagonist controlled the storm somehow and is obsessed with tracking them down before anyone else to learn their secret
- each person who makes it to the top the corrupt capitalist and fascist system sacrifices their humanity, then displays it to the rest of the population as a way justify their power and cruelty, no one gets to the top with their emotional and spiritual connections unsevered, ripped to shreds or mangled beyond recognition
- Lovecraftian horror crushes a person, using 4d limbs to create a strong negative gravity bubble around them and then constricting it, because of time dilation, person comes out a rotting pile of meat in addition to being crumpled like tissue paper 
- The storms turn out to be 4d creatures that moves through space by latching onto things with a bunch of 4d spikes, like those boots used to not make markings n wet paint, appears in 3 dimensions as a set of reflective lines of voidweave sticking out from the ground, these lines can also extend into planes, slicing things in half
- Your kind is deluded thinking that within the tools and systems your oppressors have devised and now control lies the power to create change. But know that no matter where you are among the stars, the fear of the death is universal."

Everything vibrated, the air, the stone, the structural bindings, the glass, the metal, the flesh and bone. Then, the Stormwall shattered.
Any chaos that was made by the Honored was crushed before the power of the Storm. Winds stronger than the Bindings themselves swept the Hall at the command of infinite absence. Lines of voidweave appeared instantly throughout the Hall, transforming into ribbons and sheets of midnight, shearing anything before them without resistance. Debris twisted in the air dancing into fractals, the rapidly escaping atmosphere splitting with the sound of near instant destruction. The winds, tossing everything through the infinitely fine structures of voidweave, atomizing many of the Honored in seconds. Few fought the Storm and were consumed, lightweave blades clashed with infinite nothing creating planes of death, sliced open by spacetime itself. The collision of the immovable and the unstoppable could only cause the annihilation of both. 
Malâ€™eva though, she danced.
Though the Storm threw the Hall into chaos, her people did not believe in such a thing. If their was Here, then that was all that mattered. Her people have witnessed many Storms, and the only hope was to move with it.
