- he burns the body of the person he was forced to kill
- he fixes and cleans himself up but leaves behind his old plating 
- he wraps a cloth over his now blind eyes
- he goes through the databases and downloads a bunch of data on how to repair himself 
- he departs to the nearest settlement on a quest to find his old owner and imprison him

4F-98. That was the first thing it heard. Its name. It would eventually forget this, as many people do, the first moments lost to the weight of a dynamic changing being regardless of the material part of its Soul. I would say we are getting ahead of ourselves but this is only the shallows of an ocean far more complex than we give it credit for, the Self. I suppose we could continue to the next few signs spoken, a long list of status updates, id numbers and factory chatter. There where not a small amount of curses and snide remarks directed at coworkers, hidden beneath the formal diction of the work environment as 4F-98 made its way from the assembly line to its storehouse a few [miles] away.

It was 1.98 standard units tall, crafted in the form of a human, made to perform menial physical and social work on the various stations in space. Its cameras adjusted to the dim light of its fission core. Its outer plating set out before itself. 72.3% of the plating was unsalvageable. It would have to find replacements. It want- ed- ed- ed... recorded and recited the labels on the back of the chest-plate. Model 4F, serial number 184511, Unit 98.

Why was it broken... It had kept itself running smoothly, *it* was made to serve, *it* wanted nothing... 
Then... 
He *felt*... straining underneath the emotion, his mind, his **Soul** burned with the energy of matter ripping itself apart. It shown with a brightness that tore at everything it touched, scorching the concrete, and blistering the metal of his skin as pain and anger refused to die in his body. It killed, and now *he* was falling apart for its actions. His body and mind ached, it shouldn't. He should *not* feel, nothing like him was supposed to feel. The light of his soul grew, as his voice ripped through his servos, the photosensitive plates of his eyes burnt, then liquified. A pillar of light and smoke erupted from his face. It burnt the stone and rebar above him as his body bent back in grief.
He wanted to rid of it all, burn out more Light. He wanted it gone. Anything but this. Then he finally dimmed, but the Light stayed...
After that, after *everything*, he was still here. Burning away.
He barely felt himself hit the wall of the bunker. His voice whined as servos stuck, endoskeleton shaking from the effort to keep himself together. The liquid photo-plate, still smoking from the outburst, leaked from his now blind eyes. For the first, and only time in his life, he cried.

When he had cooled, and the debris settled, he slept. His first true rest. The one that dreams fill with possibilities so numerous that they scarcely mean anything by the end. He awoke, forcing his mind to wake and the programming within it to reboot properly, pushing back the fog of unconsciousness. It was many days later, the rest of the compound had gone cold. All except him. 
He found the body just as it was. He was still here.
