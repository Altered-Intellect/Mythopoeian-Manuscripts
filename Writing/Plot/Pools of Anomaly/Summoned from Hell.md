# Plot

On the only mountain in the land of Arboria, 

Dry branch complains about his wretched mother giving him a terrible name, while preparing his summoning spell arranging the ancient artifacts to  build a portal, inputting the right coordinates

the parts were stolen cutting edge magic, some mathematical component, using ancient and powerful artifacts and getting really fucking lucky. 

there is mystic nonsense and tech presented as such 

Build up then bam summon activated 

portal is calibrated for a couple of minutes, dry branch waits for something to stumble close enough

Cut to Tod, drunk off his ass and mind, in his drunken state, utters a prayer and falls out of the universe 

there is no ceremony or flashy effects of traveling to another dimension if you do it properly, the thing simply appears with a slight disturbance in all universal fields of that dimension and then bam you have a thing from another dimension

When summoner sees what they have summoned the summoner second guesses if their spell worked because while they did summon an abomination, by looks it really doesn’t look combat ready, mainly because the human is black out drunk and knocked the fuck out. the summoner at first believes that what the summoning failed as its only expanding and contracting, it barely looks sentient. they look over their spell a couple of times and can’t figure out what happened, they are in the middle of figuring out what to do with the human before he decides to roll over and scratch his butt. the summoner decides that the thing they summoned simply needs some motivation tries hitting it with one of their weapons, this has no effect as the human stays put, they try again but harder and the human barely moves. the summoner remarks that at least this thing is hardy which should be useful, they also remark that the creature they summoned is warm/hot and is vibrating violently, because the human is snoring

the human wakes up and immediately believes they are dreaming and promptly falls back asleep

it takes quite a bit before the human figures out what is happening, as he shakes off sleep and dealing with his hangover. 

when he figures out the physic binding, he immediately gets furious and tries to break the connection, he tries everything from trying to kill the summoner then, smashing their equipment, bending a specific tool then the summoner will prevent him from doing it, rapidly becoming a mess as the summoner technically in control of the human, he just getting increasingly creative with his disobedience. The summoner finally has had enough and knocks out the human with their remaining strength, they then throw together a seal using a rare metal trinket they have, the seal transfers the humans physical energy of trying to flee into heat the metal and absorb, the seal rapidly becomes red hot as the human violently tries to do something but can’t as the seal absorbs all of the effort

The human picks up a tree

the summoner has almost complete control of the human after a while the human adapts and figures out loopholes and ways to mess with the summoner as much as possible 

because they don’t eat things by consuming them, the first time the summoner sees what that means is a little terrifying 

I have a prince to kill
god this sounds like the plot to a children's show
**Silence demon, I did not summon you to mock me!** I do not care how many of your insolent kind exist in the aether, I will kill every last one of them to see this prince dead. 
whatever you say boss, hope its doesn't bother you that I can fold you in half like a cardboard box
-the mental image of container made of pale bone flashes through the summoner mind- 

"If you think im bad then you should meet some of the other shit bags on earth."
"on earth?"
"Yup, plenty human bullshit to go around."
"Wait there are *more* of you-"
-raises eyebrow- "you really thought I was the only human in existence. I'm flattered but there are almost 8 billion of us."
-mild existential crisis- "i see..."
"you don't seem to happy about that, am i really that insufferable"
never mind that I have personal plans, your kind can wait
aww, i would have loved to see a battle between you and the American army
-the mental image of a bunch of strange weapons ripping the summoner to shreds crosses their mind- you dare plague me with images of my demise, i am your master! I command you to never do that again.
maybe if you get out of my head you would have to deal with my thought, pretty sweet deal if you ask me
fine i am severing my connection, for now. 

the summoner summoned the human for an ploy they have to take over a kingdom and killing the heir

the human is bound to the summoner due to their physic abilities and while the humans makes some good effort to prevent mind reading they aren't very good at it. because humans have no physic defenses, getting out of the binding is simply impossible 

# Characters

Tom is kinda fat and lazy because they have niche interests that can’t be capitalized on. (writer?) This makes them feel like shit all the time and they take their anger out on everyone else 

- short temper (insecure?)
- cosmic knowledge (has an education abroad)
- fire association (pyromaniac and human)
- lots of raw power but can be bound (no physic abilities or protection against them)
- trickster and manipulators (extremely sarcastic and likes to mess with people)
- strange powers to make people suddenly dead (diseases?)
- incomprehensible (human thinks in both written words and spoken English, likes to makes references to human culture)

Dry branch was exiled from his clan because he is constantly pissy and doesn’t like people, he wants power, just so he can be left alone and so people can stop being so annoying, he is happy to be alone on the only mountain in the land 

This project is to highlight earth as something analogous to hell and the underworld for a magical ent/goblin like species

The gravity on this ecosystem is half that of earth so the ents bones are made of carbon chains and cellulous, basically wood, their skin and flesh are similar to that of a fruit, most have a layer of bark-like skin 

the most flimsy animals having bones with the strength similar to a root vegetable, and flesh like a fungus

Some larger animals of this dimension have a hard layer of bark that acts like exoskeleton or a protective shell 

droopy frill-leaves live in watery environments, look a bit like an axolotl, bark is soft 

needle like frill/leaves that form feather like structures, vaguely owl-like live in cold environments, 

they have a bunch of flaps that are similar to both frills and leaves, filled with photosynthetic bacteria that feeds them, these flaps are stretched between branch like appendage they are blue greenand can range from bright blue in high sunlit areas to dark green in darker areas

they don't have a proper central circulatory system and instead have a free flowing liquid similar to sap, it is much runnier in their bodies but when out side becomes more viscus and sap like 

to them death is thick and vicus like sap exposed to the air, things that are sweet are a sign of the passage of time and strongly linked with decay 

Flowers are what smell “sweet” to them

they have no control of their body temperature and are completely “cold-blooded”

they are red green colorblind and for them this is actually good color vision, but they can see a bit into the uv spectrum as their dimension is filled with sunlight 

Their coins are clay inside a thin ring of iron 

They build their buildings out of a dirt clay and sand mixture that is similar to concrete but is much lighter and easier to use for the ents 

the plants of this world are similar to vines, grasses, and shrubs but are mostly alien and grow at a much lower temperature 

most of the species on their planet have a lower body temperatures than creatures on earth and move much slower, they are a slight exception being able to move faster because of their physic abilities

they might not live on planets, ringworld?, floating islands? there is a constant breeze 

most species have physic abilities in their dimension, this is because information can affect the world around it if is sentient

Humans are much larger and taller than the tree people and have much longer limbs 
humans are extremely receptive to physic healing
Humans are unable to perform physic abilities but have a much higher energy density than the tree people so can power up and fuel the tree people 

The tree people are much more sheltered as a culture and don’t have a lot of gruesome concepts in their vocabulary. plus their entire system of energy distribution in the environment has nothing to do with killing and eating other beings to survive. its is done through physic nonsense and photosynthesis

the tree people communicate either through a sign language or through telekinesis

This environment does not have wide spread disease, symiotic bacteria is virtually nonexistent, the tree people are the exception

the summoner tries to use the human reading comprehension to read the humans mind, since the human both thinks in written and spoken English. the spoken part makes it super hard to concentrate and also English is a nightmare of a language so the summoner gets extremely disoriented trying to understand what the human is thinking

English words mean multiple things, have entirely different meanings when broken down, Some English words are spelled strange, memes, jokes and metaphors obscure meanings 

the demon the next tier up on the scariness ladder used gravitational waves and a more power form of telekinesis to communicate, has an even higher energy density than humans, maybe they eat the minds of sentient beings and that is how they feed
