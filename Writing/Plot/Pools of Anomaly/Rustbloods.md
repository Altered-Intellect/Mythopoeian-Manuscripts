on one of the blasted out asteroids of the gas giants in the [[Sol]] system, gladiatorial combat is extremely popular entertainment, the center of social structure of the small and the unofficial conduct in which species clash with the Terrans as the various cultures of Terra discover the technology to travel the stars, 
>“You can tell it’s blood,” he says matter-of-factly, “because ordinary rust turns the grinding water brown. If it’s blood rust it bleeds, it looks like blood in the water. Even 2,000 years old, it bleeds. And it smells like a steak cooking, like cooked meat. I’ve encountered this before with Japanese swords from World War II. If there’s blood on the sword and you start polishing it, the sword bleeds. It comes with the territory.”
>Blood rust: I hadn’t thought of that. I guess it would turn water red, but the steak comment is kind of creeping me out, as is the growing realization that if these swords could talk, I couldn’t stomach half the tales they’d have to tell.

My opponent this cycle was in equal lengths intimidating and strange. They were a local from the system's habitable planet, which was the source of every attention possible in recent times. They were taller on two legs instead of four. Frustratingly, they had refused armor. This would have made sense if they had any natural defenses as I did, but this species had none. Its skin, mottled and stripped with brown and tan, was mockingly exposed. Incapacitating them *should* be easy. They sauntered onto the battlefield, making sweeping gaudy gestures to the crowd. As chaotic cheers in tens if tounges rose in response, I noticed something strange around the back of their right hand. A circular metal plate was secured by a foreign material I could not distinguish. A religious symbol? For Luck? This one was cracked through with mystery... By rumor I heard their heritage and origin was obscured even by the standards of the regulations in the gladiatorial ring. I was curious what this meant for their species, but sadly the investigation was for the scholars. I was simply sent here to fight.

I brandished my weapon, a double-bladed spine that was almost my height. They had an iron weapon as well, a short single-bladed blade and a shield of a combat grade iron-ceramic weave. Both blades were made of field-steel, sharpened to the point they could cleave stone easily. My stomachs sank as the gravity of the arena increased, the billowing dust from the crowd quickly settling. The match was about to start. The human had already bent their legs in preparation. Even crouched, their eyes were level with mine. It seemed balance would win this battle. 

The human made no attempt to do any pre-battle rituals, so I began mine. In a quick series of swings and with a stinging hum, my iron spine was set alight. It glowed brightly as sand shifted with the bellowing signal to start. My breath finally steadied. Closing the distance, I struck out in a tight arc. They shifted and jabbed a counter. The arcs clashed and I changed stances. Attacking again and again, the strikes narrowly avoided and rebuffed. The clang of shield and spine fell into a rhythm, yet the aggression never provoked them out of defense. They were leveraging endurance, so I changed step. Then, as my stance shifted, they struck. A wide swing with all their weight behind it. I leapt and by an eyes length it missed. The human’s momentum was carried onto another defensive posture. I heaved a breath, this needed a quick end. With no hesitation I leapt at the human, swiping their spine directly. I twisted the strike of the attack into my own counter, aiming the center of mass of the spine outward. The force of the maneuver sent the spine spinning out of the human’s grip.

I swung my blade at the human's now defenseless arm as they crouched low. Bracing. The air vibrated with the strike. Metal connected with bone beneath flesh as it seared a gash of deep red ichor. Strangely, it smelled of stone ground against steel. Pain ripped from the breath of the human, but they stood. *This* is why they where named Ironborn. Blood the color of rust, and a soul of burning steel to match my own. This was an opponent I could respect. They gripped their forearm to stanch the blood flow, but it still leaked for their fingered. They let out a growl and glared, with perfectly circular pupils, straight through me. I had landed the first blow, it was time for them to choose. I held the tip of my spine to their head.

"Do you surrender."

"No."

Then, their eyes fell open. The black of their pupils grew, only contained by the rings of light that replaced their gaze. Across the arena, the human’s spine burst with a cold patterned light, matching the molten light of my spine. Then it *disappeared*, reappearing in the human’s bloodied right hand soon after. They struck out in a tight arc, which glanced off my faceplate. The gash on their arm tilted their angle of attack wildly, straining the balance of my defense. They adjusted stances to thrust. The arcs clashed again and again, the strikes narrowly avoided or blocked by my increasingly fractured exoskeleton. The clang of spine against chitin fell into a rhythm. My defense could not resist their attack, so I changed step to counter. Then, as my stance shifted, they struck.

They leaned into another full body attack, launching it against the force of the arena's gravity. The spine flashed through the joint of my upper arm, and my grip went numb. Chitin shrieked as the human withdrew. My spine fell, sinking point first into the sand. Reflex blocked the next strike, clanging off metallic chitin. I ducked out of the next strike, my other hand almost missing my spine’s retrieval. Putrid smelling purple plasma had begun to flow from my wound. I was not as practiced with weak handed combat, and my stamina was at its limit. The battle was now decided. The human's spine still lingered with finely roiling light. Strange smelling blood bled from them, smelling of sheared iron and burnt flesh. They were clearly worn as they strained their breath but something kept them on their feet. Yet, I could not afford to fight any further. I knelt with my spine, settling its handle in the sand, and surrendered.

The number one thing the Jace hated about the Arena was the bloodloss, but the second was the puns. *Specifically* Kimix's puns, which he was doing his best to ignore at the moment. Normally, Jace didn't mind puns, they could be annoying once in while but on the whole, they where a joke, and Jace liked jokes. The problem was... well, Kimix's pun never made any sense. They seemed to have a hard time understanding the complex inner workings of linguistic comedy, or maybe they understood it too well, either way it didn't stop their enthusiasm.
"that fight was quite the boiler, wasn't it?"
Jace passed him without comment.
"you could say it was a... *plateful*" Kimix's canine face broke out into a grin. Their tall thin frame swayed with laughter, high pitched and like a howl. Jace continued walking to the food court.
"Come, ooon al-hacho, you didn't think that was even a little funny." He said, bounding to Jace. 
Scowling at the floor he muttered, "I almost lost to that armored insect guy..."
"Yeah, and you had to pull out your super special move, I know, that's exactly *why* I made the joke."
"That's not how comedy works."
Kimix tilted their head back in faux shock, "Oh really! The Priest King of Seriousness has an explanation to comedy of all things? I'd love to hear it!" He abruptly looked thoughtful. "Does that mean the Priest King of Silliness has the answer to why you are always scowling at everyone?"
"Whatever, lets shut up about this. I want some food."
The food court was also on Jaces list of most hated things in the Arena, but quite a bit further down. Food is still *food*, and there where few other pleasures than a full meal after a close call in battle, even if most of the stuff was colorless mush or strangely flavored gelatin. Jace walked over to the machine in the wall, ignoring the other contestants, and punched in his order. He guessed they where giving him nasty looks but with the gaping wound of biological and cultural continuity, Jace couldn't care less. Violence was forbidden outside of the battle zone and punishment was harsh, rank demotion. He didn't have much physical weight to throw around but his reputation and height gave him plenty of the metaphorical so no one ever bothered him outside of some meaningless insults about body parts he didn't have.

Kimix's humors seemed to revolve around word play of a grammar that was so complex and convoluted it was amazing that he still retained the language after so many years

the human body could apparently survive on only half its blood, barely, but graciously the Medic tended to treat you before that. They want to keep their job and that was to keep you in fighting shape, 'cause that the best way to make credit. The feeling of your life leaving you, reducing you to shaky breaths and sprig-legs, that was never fun. 

The meaning of a dead tired stare easily transcended the cultural boundaries between species
