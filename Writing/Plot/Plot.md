# [[Tales of Terra]]
Terra is an analogue to Earth in this universe. The continents are in similar spots, divisions are familiar, but humanities relationship with its world is fundamentally different. The forces of Nature do not bend as easily and retaliate twice as hard. Vast ecosystem will turn upon the forces that try and uproot it, changing both in the process. It is a super-earth in both the literally and metaphorical sense. 
The only technology that can be made is from the Cultures of Terra and the Nature that surrounds them, both Culture and Nature have no problems turning in on themselves and on each other but there are rules that can not be broken by either. The only way to survive the weather is to divert it, the only way for the environment to persist is through the lives of its ecology, the only way to survive the spread of [[Hominid]](s), the [[Celephalopod]](s) and the [[Draconic]](s) forces is to change with it.
