the story of a world reborn as its words become flesh
One of the leviathan voids was sick, and it was not devouring the signs and bindings on the surface if the signa void, its digestions marred by the collapse of a local dark star and its eco system, so when the void collapses, all of the grazes with magic that the world was going through suddenly crystallize at a rapid rate, throwing the world into chaos

>Have you heard of neutronium? Now imagine a material ten times stronger than that, and only triple the weight of titanium. That's what it's made out of. Do you know how it powers itself? It has a metabolism which pulls energy from hidden dimensions. Entropy? *It's the thing that causes it.*

# Notepad
- A student scientist discovers the secret world of magic with the other main characters, while the others are swept away in awe at magic and all that it can do, the student is terrified as they know what ridiculous forces and risks are behind the breaking the laws of physics the way that magic does, and it’s not the standard attack spells, explosive forces are natural. it’s the invisibility, mind swap, shape-shifting, and transmutation spells that freak them out. Because of this awareness they avoid several catastrophes with magic gone wrong. Impressed with their knowledge and receptiveness the student is taken in by one of the prestigious high ranking mages

# Unbinding Madness
the setting is about the sapient species of [[Nebos]], a species that lives on a completely Signa deficient planet being trained as psychics, learning teleportation, telepathy, telekinesis, etc. under the slowly growing influence of interplanar and other worldly beings
the classic psychic abilities because of the Lovecraftian horrors that drift in and between spaces, we can correlate to many things as it will start to disrupt their minds, depression, cynicism and existential dread all exist as plagues in the [[High Glider]]s because of these incomprehensible beings that break all bonds, and consume most Signa in the system
Lovecraft's work was centered on nihilism, pessimism and the horror of the unknown. It highlighted the terror and discomfort in the blending or breaking of defined barriers. What I want to do when writing my own take on this theme is to turn to optimistic nihilism. Existence is terror and loss, but its love and meaning in equal amounts. Change and the complexity of reality can also inspire and awe as much as it instills terror 
>"The pain is never-ending and so is the love." 

Eldritch gods exist, these Lovecraftian horrors are generally unknowable far more complex, than terrestrial life, hence why they are commonly referred to gods of dread, nightmares, and death despite not being directly bound the the concepts, its more accurate to say they automatically trigger these reaction in living things due to vast differences in ecology and biology
Existential dread in the [[High Glider]](s) is their minds pushing up against these eldritch beings and the incomprehensible in their back yard 
The incomprehensible change enough to make them seem strange compared to its original concept. Anything that has that feeling of warping reality, the strange and mythic 

the horror of Lovecraft is demonstrated best with the metaphor of an ant on a circuit board, we are the ants and our universe is a the circuit board, the horror doesn't come from the ant navigating the circuit board but, for a brief moment, understanding the purpose of its design
to many other species, we are massive, ancient beings with unfathomable knowledge of the universe and a tendency to wipe them out in a passing thought
people go insane when they can suddenly comprehend everything and are unable to describe what they see, this insanity can be reversed through therapy and social support, yes some spiral and end up breaking under the strain or giving into destruction, but there is always a chance for recovery with the right support, this stress can cause a host of long term mental illness but as positive, they keep some of their infinite knowledge, all survivors gain incredible senses of intuition on specific things associated with their recovery, they learn to adapt to their mental illnesses and keep growing and changing, refusing to let go of their personhood and potential despite overwhelming loss of functionality.
the Lovecraftian horror I want to capture this feeling of both positive and negative encounters with the incomprehensible and that not everything the is incomprehensible is on the same level, 
there are forces that are so strange we are never going to fully understand them and then the realization that the true nature of the universe is a roiling mess of probability that will never be completely known
Nearly all of the conspiracies on [[Nebos]] are true in some capacity, their dinosaurs were intelligent, aliens, psychics, and scifi tech exist, lovecraftian horrors drift between unseen realms, the government is hiding more than just military tech, magic is real and tin foil hats do protect you from mind control, kinda

### The Nameless City (in the unbinding space)
the setting is in an old city, around 210 years pre-contact
at the beginning there is a strong sense of togetherness as many people from all walks of life have dreams of this mysterious city, some see the architecture, some see statues and artifacts within the city, some feel the presence of the people who live in the city but never see them directly, always out of shadowed doorways, blurry vision or in the peripheral.
the city is actually just the [Information Age High Glider Culture] trying to figure out what they are dreaming about, its not actually a city but it something they can't really comprehend, they are the cultures interpretation of their own [[World Tree]] as an influx of Signa is dumped into their ecosystem from the dying breaths of an interplanar leviathan, the future and past of the place these people live in, being revealed and changed by something unknown
the main character is a journalist working for the cities news distributors
centers around the founding of the secret society that plays a major role in future stories
