## Setting 
is a super small town on [[Thalasia]] in one of the few deserts that the planet has. It has a population mostly composed of the older generations, the nursery home takes up a half of the population, the town is filled with older stories and tales of the fantastic, cryptids, murder, the unexplained, half of which is quirks of mundane reality, and the other is the infinite depths of the unknown

Story of five [[High Glider]] young adults (around end of high school) and their abduction by an ancient religious cult as a retaliation against the state government as it tries to restrict its practices to contact the wider universe. 

## Outline

Prologue

- Random materials are stolen by the secret society and reported missing, government notices
- the secret society monitors the sky for  [[Eyl]] falls from space in a cyst
- the cyst bounces across the landscape trying to rid it's kinetic energy without destroying itself, it plots course with the most bounces 
- a traitor smuggles it away as they don’t trust the secret society with it
- [[Eyl]] escapes, the traitor flees

Book one - three

- Conner is out at his secret cave base and is followed by [[Eyl]]
- Conner shoots up as a warning shot, [[Eyl]] tries jumping away b/c the gun is loud, Conner hits [[Eyl]] anyway
- Conner hears on the news that blood was found and is confused and then realizes that he actually shot something in the sky
- Tries to keep it a secret from sister but she is nosy and finds out anyways by snooping
- The “FBI” goes to investigate the case as they figured out it blood, Samantha does some research and recognizes that this isn’t the FBI but the secret service
- Realizing what is going on the twins try and figure out what the heck Conner shot, following various leads
- In their pursuit of knowledge on what is happening they meet many interesting characters and do some wacky things
- interrogating a kid that has a parent scientist that once worked at a facility that was sus,
- crashing the school dance
- and interviewing and talking with several conspiracy theorists
- someone who worked as a janitor at Area 51
- they eventually sneak into Area 51
- Samantha finds two scientists-cultists coming out of a secret base in the desert that is just as hidden as Conners base, she sees them moving parts of the portal
- when they get information from area 51 there is a document on the disappearance of the five kids from the five-man band, this detail particularly stumps them because the group seems to have disappeared into thin air with out any explanation
- Conner and Samatha find the cave [[Eyl]] is living in, Conner tries to communicate with [[Eyl]], while Samantha chooses to track it and tries to tag it somehow
- The twins at one point steal the translator device, and Conner uses it to communicate to [[Eyl]] and they get to know them
- The goal is to now send [[Eyl]] back
- Interview ex-society members
- While they are gathering information and materials to do this, they go on various adventures, most of which are outside of the small town (las vegas, grand canyon, truck stops, and 7 elevens,
- [[Eyl]] is hunted down by “FBI”
- Ends with the not FBI capturing [[Eyl]]

the government is making a scary weapon from tech involving the other planet when the government is experimenting, a link is formed with [[Eyl]] and both parties keep messing with each other

- a secret society is in a feud with the government about the government research on the other planet

The secret society is made up of rejected scientists who found out about the theory of this other realm and people who believe them. The leader takes the secret society way too seriously. The society started out as a safe space for the rejected scientists and was centered around more than just opening the portal and included alot more research, but when the leader joined, they started to advocate specifically to construct a portal using the research already available, saying that they could be the first to talk to aliens. They try many things like a special radio, sending in drones, sending people, and finally trying to bring something back. This of course made the government take notice and thus the feud started.

The not FBI was set up when [[Eyl]] was sent to earth and is researching it, and possibly a way to send him home with his knowledge. This was set up to also look into any mysteries that could be solved by a connection to this other planet. When the secret society popped up and started to try and create their own way to this other planet, a division of this research group was created to stop the secret society as they don’t trust the secret society.

Society leader hires poacher to track [[Eyl]], but not to kill it. When they finally catch [[Eyl]], the group splits in two as half of the poachers want to kill it and the others don’t. (This split could be set off by the not FBI or a member in the society that does want to take the risk of trying to keep [[Eyl]] alive) There is alot of arguing until Conner and Samatha crash the confrontation and come to the rescue.

Strange events that happen:
A historical event affects the present in town (discovery of the town on now forgotten resource, dust storm hid something ancient, connection to some long lost anomaly that the town over sits on) 
The public raids a government facility
- Conner and Samatha use it as an excuse to snoop and try and break-in

Breaking into the rival public school
Visiting The Dam, the desert city, (i.e. alien Las Vegas), and alien metropolis New York, 
Time traveler dies in an rift accident and leaves their Time Machine is left behind for someone to rebuild 
Someone 3d prints the throat of an ancient king to see what their voice sounded like, a cult steals it and chaos ensues

Connection to the five-man band plot
- Bounty on the group’s heads; mentioned by [[Eyl]] 
- A scientist is sent to the planet is unable to return and is forced to survive on the planet, they eventually run into the drakes and ends up befriending one of them, they eventually run into the five-man band and becomes the group’s babysitter, the scientist is also able to help them get back as they worked on the equipment that they used to get to the planet in the first place

List of possible leads
- Someone who wanted a new life and ran away
- A very small vlogger and his investigations, they meet him in real life and do a video with him, despite having a small number of followers, he let the power go directly to his head, explore how a person could let so little power go to their head, family, personality, the environment they live in
- A psychic shows up in the town and is pretty fishy, mainly because the amount of strange stuff that start happenings dramatically increase
- A reformed and new alien conspiracy theorist, the retired theorist convinces the government that his whole conspiracy thing was an act so he can retire, he offers to do public service for his troubles and says if he can pick what stuff to do
- Various scientists and researchers, paleontologist, biologist 

False leads
- an old man claims to be a scientist of some kind and tells them he know something about their investigations, they soon discover he was just lonely and liked the company but he does have a lot of useful stuff in his house and it’s ambiguous if the old man is a scientist because he can’t remember stuff after a certain date, they try and find out why he lost his memory and find some cool thing about his past but it turns out it was just plain amnesia.

Conner and Samantha’s cave of operations slowly become a proper secret base, and in the future become on of the most secure places on [[Nebos]], as it becomes a massive repository of secrets 

The story starts with either the first day of science camp or the day before
- The main characters are put into groups of 9 that are subdivided into groups of three
- there are 45 kids
- The leader, the big guy, and the smart guy are put into a group
- The emotional heart and lancer are put into the other groups with two other random characters
The following day shenanigans happen and our group finds themselves lost in a forest, they don't get found because they don't know how to work together
How are they transported, where do they land on the alien planet (oceanic plains, uncannily normal forest, hilly area, floating island) do they teleport together, or do they need to find one another? Will they be in forgotten tech areas or will they just be teleported wherever. What do they do after, what are their reactions to the realization that they aren’t on earth, where do each of them think they are,
The series is like doctor stone but instead of teaching the exact thing you need to make a lightbulb it is about discovery and making inventions like the lightbulb out of the environment through research, experiments, and iteration. To take the concept of science and apply it to this fantastical world, the group invents a lot of cool gadgets based on real concepts and inventions
The leader eventually gets the team to work together and puts aside his grudge with the lancer. Once the friendship machine is chugging he soon realizes he isn’t as smart as the others and he thinks he is and has a mental breakdown and his newly made friends need to help him regain his confidence to lead, as they struggle to coordinate their effort not die without his leadership
The leader tries to flirt with the heart and tries to force a love triangle with the lancer but the heart isn’t his type (lancer makes a remark about how buff the heart is and compares her to a man)
Then their first encounter with magic happens, everyone but the leader rationalizes what they saw away, but he is convinced that what he saw was has massive consequences and ends up saving either the entire team or most of it (maybe this whole thing pulls him out of his existential crises)
A small arc where the group has to solve a mystery and each of the characters fall into roles in a murder mystery show, the lancer is the Sherlock Holmes and main detective, the leader falls into the role of Watson,
The leader tries to recreate a party in this new world as he doesn't want to grow up and not experience something like that(?)

## Writing

[[Eyl]] falling into the largest [[Signa Star]] in the galaxy and being transported to the [[Nebos]] system
Pg. 1
1. 1/2 pg : the night sky of space, a spark of a planet reflecting the light of the local star, there is a stream of stars from the local galaxy
2. 1/4 pg : a small dark brown figure drifts through space, approaching the corona of local star the lines of its magnetic fields shift and twist around it, the shot is from far away and its hard to tell its shape
3. : the scene zooms in as the figure falls through the corona highlighting the movement of the magnetic lines as they become slightly denser, the figure is more discernible with the its shape being vaguely mammalian with a long tail, four long limbs, and two round ears visible, it is posed in a roughly fetal position. the panel is noticeably brighter
Pg. 2
1.  : the wall of light that is the star comes into view. the fur of the figure is visible and its eyes are closed, the edges of it fur catch the light of the magnetic lines, the panel is even brighter
2. : the scene is a full-body of the figure in Pg. 1, including its tail. the patterns of the magnetic fields of the sun continue to dance around them, the sun is noticeably closer 
3. the figure slams into the star in a blaze of light
Pg. 3
1. the figures eyes are open, the colors of the previous pages are inverted, everything is bathed in white-yellow light. Despite the light, the figure is pitch black, the magnetic lines are shimmering with rainbows of color and weave themselves into patterns that look like layers of fabric
2. a sphere imbedded with a hyperbolic honeycomb is reflected in the large eyes of the focus character, the space is a kaleidoscope of color and light, with the exception of a single cell which is 
3. the darkness of the hyperbolic space and the main character overlap

Introduction 
Pg. 4
1. Conner standing at the edge of his neighborhood looking out to hundreds of miles of desert with a small backpack stuffed with his favorite snacks on his back. The moon is a sliver in the night sky. 
2. he jogs through the rocks and small bushes till he reaches the base of a small mountain, picking his way to his hideout. 
3. He steps down a crevasse and ducks inside a cave, his base of operations. 
4. Once inside he pulls out a lamp from a hole in the wall and places it on a small pile of rock, orienting it just the right way to get the right lighting and make sure people from the outside can't see the light. 
5. Next, he takes a broom out from underneath a pit of sand and starts sweeping the sand on the floor into it. 
6. When he’s satisfied, he sets the broom down and walks over to a stone. 
Pg. 5
1. he unlodges it from its position, pulling out a large leather bag containing his most prized position. 
2. Swiftly scooping up the bag and carefully emptying its contents, he takes out a visor, a pair of black gloves, a black vest, and some black knee and heel pads. Together these consisted of the latest VR console released, the Immersion 4K Ultra, the totally “gamer” looking VR set with flash RGB lighting and perfectly beveled edges. It was extremely ridiculous and he loved it. 
3. Excited to get started he straightens out the carefully bundled up cords and plugs them into a remarkably small custom computer. Making sure the computer is properly ventilated and the rubber on the bottom is gripping properly he sets it on a smooth flat stone that he picked out specifically for this purpose. He worked a long time to get all of this stuff out here without any suspicion and he’s finally able to use it all properly. 
4. Putting on the VR suit Conner has a permanent grin plastered on his face, first the kneepads and heel pads, then the vest followed by the gloves, and last but not least the visor. Powering it up and logging on Conner dives headfirst into another world. He does art, some notes and design, chatting with friends but nothing too interesting happens. It is a normal night. Tonight he wasn’t feeling the late-night slog as usual so decided to stay up later, to work on a special project. At around 1:00 he decides to wrap it up and puts everything back where it needs to be and starts to head back to his house.

Walking back to his house was always quiet beside the occasional scuttle of a lizard or rustle of a rabbit in the nearby bushes, but, of course, today was an exception. About a minute after exiting his hideout he hears a relatively quiet "thump". Instinctively, he whips around and trying to scramble the pistol out of the bag. It sounded several times larger than any coyote. Waiting several minutes and seeing nothing, he turns around and continues walking. His mind turns the sound over in his head, what could have made it? After a couple of minutes of walking and swearing he could hear something following him, a pile of rocks shifts. This time he is ready and wips around with both knife and gun firing near the pile of rocks. Momentarily stunned from the bang of the shot apparently forgetting that guns do that, he manages to trip himself. At the sight of a near-blinding flash he scrambles to his feet and booking it home at top speed with the only thought on his mind, “I really shouldn't be staying up this late.”

The next day the story shifts to Samantha's perspective with her waking up with her brother already gone to school as usual. She talks about her homeschooling and what she does in her free time, which is reading or watching detective, cop, and murder mystery shows, is a bit obsessed. She is also good at puzzle creation and has a series of puzzles that she has a story around, her brother is convinced she needs to create a game around it. Before her brother comes home she goes to a literature and history club where she has some friends. The chapter ends with Conner coming home from school and Sam noticing an odd uncharacteristic jumpiness from him. She immediately jumps into detective mode thinking her first case will be about her brother.

The story shifts back from Sam to Conner, the next day he finds an article about his run-in with the creature and starts to research more about what people know about it. Over the course of a couple of days, he doesn’t find anything worth noting or that he hasn’t already thought of. The only thing useful that he found was a video series that someone in the FBI was recording about their findings at the case that wasn't classified, this let him know roughly what the FBI was doing.

Meanwhile, Sam is investigating Conner's weird behavior and spies on him, finding him researching the strange case that happened that day and the mysterious disappearance of a 17-year-old boy, the same time the weird behavior started. Immediately finding the connections with some questions which got suspicious responses confirming her theory of her brother having some involvement with the mystery. She tells her friends about her theories most of them think she is a bit crazy but her best friend finds her idea interesting and suggests her to stay low and see if she can find a reason for his involvement, maybe do a bit of out of house spying.

Almost a week has passed and Conner is going a little crazy over the fact that he can’t go to his hideout because of everything from his family to the FBI. And on top of that he can’t get his sister to get off his back about the beast mystery and the recent disappearance of the 17-year-old boy named Theo. He has also caught her spying making Conner nervous that his sister might know about his involvement or is suspicious of it.

When Conner finally gets the chance he is met by his friends online asking him where he has been acting as an introduction to them. After the introduction, Conner tells them about the beast encounter and why he has been away and his suspicion of his sister knowing. Everyone’s mind gets blown and his friends start theorizing about what it could be, how to get his sister to stop spying, and what to do next (they are all nerds of some sort). They talk for the rest of the night to catch up on things that they missed. When he gets home he is met with a very tired sister wanting answers.

The story then shifts Sam’s perspective explaining how she pieced everything together even with the giant holes that needed evidence. After that she drills her brother on what happened, there is an attempt at an argument but both of them don't want to wake up their parents. Conner reconsiders, then finally breaks, also telling her about what happened and his secret hideout. She still thinks that her brother is holding back information but she doesn’t care she got the answers she needed. After a moment of silence, Conner abruptly grins and asks where her base of operations is, saying if he spilled she needs to also. She reluctantly showed him the secret part of their closet behind several pairs of old outfits. The small space was filled with candy wrappers, a corkboard filled with the content you would expect on a conspiracy theorists back wall, and a small laptop with several memory drives on a makeshift desk. Conner makes a comment on how messy the place is and Sam responds with, yeah like your place is any better. Connor rolled his eyes and said they should probably move all of her stuff to the cave so it wouldn’t be found by their parents. At first, she protests saying that she has hidden the place for so long but then agrees because they will now be working together and it would be nice not having to worry about her mom finding out about the place 24/7.

Over the course of a couple of days Sam and Conner move the corkboard, the laptop, and memory drives and folders filled with information into the cave, it is a bit cramped but way bigger than a closet. The two start to combine their data and knowledge about the mystery. Conner finds out from his sister's data on the FBI investigations which is more than expected, way more. The next week is filled with investigation and questions yet to be answered. With all the investigating Conner and Sam get into shenanigans around the town trying to get clues. The pair also investigate the disappearance of Theo. They do this by prodding their sitter about him and what happened. The sitter is a classic visco girl and was raised in a very rich household, despite her snobbishness she genuinely loves hanging out with kids and will often take them to some expensive place when she has nothing else to do. She was forced to sit for the kids by her parents at a young age, initially hating the job but started to love it as she has a knack for taking care of kids. She has been sitting for them since they were little and was a main influence on both of their growth.

"have you seen this plant before?" the agent asked gesturing the small jar on her desk. 
they both sat motionless, too confused to respond, she continued as if it was supposed to be a rhetorical question
"its a plant that is often found growing in the patches of granite scattered throughout the desert in the area, if you read the report we sent you, you would know that it is not native to Thalasia, we have no idea how it got on this planet..."
the biochemists' wings fell to the floor in disbelief, "H-how do you know that?!"
"Exactly why you where brought here, its biological, informational, and molecular structure is built around a complex system of internal chemical reactions, which splits silicate bonds, externally. Nothing like it is found on the planet as the mechanism it uses to thrive is completely incomprehensible to any known theory, both modern and ancient. Your job is to expand our understanding of this mechanism, confirming its extraterrestrial origin is redundant" 
The linguist was less impressed, "I don't see how this cloud chasing is relevant to my field."
She walked over to the jar and picked it up, "The terrarium is made from 'metallic glass' a newly developed material as this plant would slowly split apart the glass into sand. this alien organism would turn the mountains of our cities to deserts if given the chance." she made a point of tilting the jar to the linguist in case he didn't already get a good look, "and yet..."
then she took out a small labeled vial of table salt from the single pile of stuff on the desk. she opened and dumped the contents into the jar. The effect was immediate, the light yellow shine of the sprouts where replaced with a dark brown of withering stalks within seconds.
The biochemists ruffled their feather in excitement, eyes wide. This time it was the linguists turn to gape, feathers shuddering. 
"The only thing holding this plant in this valley is the unique weather patterns surrounding it, the high salinity of the ocean winds prevent the spore like seeds from migrating across the mountains. They have been confined to this valley for the last two hundred years."
"How do you already know so much about this species, its an alien organism..."
"we have had a small team of botanists and speculative biologists studying its life cycles and basic biological properties. I have been working closely with the team, and my background in meteorology has provided much needed context surrounding the situation"
"there are many basic rules that biological organism follow that can be applied, many of them have proven useful in study"

*NEED REVISION TO MATCH NEW LORE*
It was 2 am and I needed to get an essay on an infamously boring book completed by morning for a presentation that had been announced, what [three months] ago? I don't remember and wasn't up for a thrilling ride of failures of a guy trying to kill an oversized fish. The lumps in my mattress probably provided more variation in engagement than the entire book combined, so I decided to seize the opportunity to get some extra sleep. I carefully climbed the stairs to my room making sure to miss the squeaky fifth and eighth step and made my way into my room. I crept up the ladder on the bunk bed, especially making sure I didn’t wake my sister. I closed my eyes and let my mind wander so my slight grogginess could take over my brain. My body’s willingness to move seemed to float off with my conscience as I relaxed into my blankets and pillows. All the worries of school forced out of my brain to make way for a stream of possibility and imagination.

Mornings, the worst curses modern humanity, period. Sure it's nice the first five seconds when you're in that half-conscious state where thoughts can drift, but then reality decides to ground you, hopefully out of your bed, but most likely further into the comfort of your blankets and pillows. Oh, and your mom slept through her alarm and is yelling, you slept on your leg wrong and you somehow have to climb down from the top bunk of your bed without waking your homeschooled sister, who conveniently sleeps like a traumatized rabbit. Then you have to pack all of your school things because of course, you forgot to do that yesterday, check if you have everything, or don't because you're late, get dressed, eat breakfast, brush your teeth, and jump into the car in the ten-minute window provided. If you Signage to pull that off, your home free. Oooh... wait, you forgot your Language binder...

Put school here?

Anyway, enough talk about the despair of teenage life so we can get to the part that is actually interesting. I eventually got home from the sleep fest that is school and I ran to my room. Unloading all my school stuff to do my homework. I usually don’t do all of it and just do enough to get me C's so I don’t get grounded for life. After all that I would eat dinner and then "I would go to bed".

Instead of actually going to sleep I waited till everyone was in bed and quickly gathered up a bag filled with snacks, a pistol my dad bought me for a gun class and a survival knife gifted to me by my grandpa for my 13th birthday. After I got everything I double-checked to see if everyone was fast asleep and I disappeared into the night.

I stood on the edge of my neighborhood, facing up to hundreds of miles of desert in all directions but where I was heading was only a couple minutes away. I ran about 100 meters at about a 45-degree angle into the dessert which really wasn't that deserted. Coyotes were famous for breaking into people's yards and eating any dogs or cats that were out, and sometimes high schoolers liked to have parties way too close to my base of operations, giving a purpose for the gun and knife in my bag, just in case. The weapons were thankfully only for the trip there and back as you had to be standing right in front of my hideout to figure out what it was. If you ask me this personal bat cave of mine (given it was much, much, smaller), was the only thing keeping me from losing my sanity. The cave was about 7 by 5 by 4 1/2 ft. with the ceiling being a bit low but domed so it wasn't that bad. The floor was a little dusty as sand and dirt would get blown into the cave and occasionally a lizard would visit and do their business. I wrinkled my nose at the smell. After I finished cleaning up, I walked over to a stone and unlodged it from its position revealing a large leather bag containing my most prized position. I scooped up the bag and carefully emptied its contents, a visor, a pair of black gloves, a black vest, and some black knee and heel pads. I straightened out the carefully bundled up cords and plugged them into a remarkably small custom computer that I built with my dad. Together these consisted of the latest VR console released, the Immersion 4K Ultra, the “gamer” looking VR set with flash RGB lighting and perfectly beveled edges. It was extremely ridiculous and I loved it. I spent A LOT of time babysitting, mowing lawns, and cleaning yards to get the money to get this. I spent even more time making sure that my parents didn't know that I had it, my mom isn't too big on the idea of VR. After putting on all the gear which fitted comfortably thanks to it being custom, I logged on to my personal account and dove headfirst into another world.

I did what I always do when I log on to the Emersion 4K Ultra, messing around online, playing multiplayer games and chatting with online friends around the world. If I had the energy I would work on coding mini-games and programs, creating art, and taking free online classes that piqued my interest. I would most of the time spend about 4-5 hours online but I wasn't feeling the late-night slog as I usually did so I decided to finish an art project taking about an hour and a half more. After I shut everything down and put everything back into place I grabbed my bag with the knife, gun, and now empty wrappers and started to head home to see if I could squeeze any sleep in.

Walking back to my house was always quiet beside the occasional scuttle of a lizard or rustle of a rabbit in the nearby bushes, but, of course, today was an exception. About a minute after I exit my hideout I hear a relatively quiet "thump" that I immediately identified as being something several times larger than any coyote. Instinctively, I whip around and try to scramble the pistol out of the bag. Waiting several minutes and seeing nothing, I turned around and continued walking. After a couple of minutes of walking and swearing I can hear something following me, I hear a pile of rocks shift. This time I'm ready and whip around with both knife and gun firing near the pile of rocks. I was momentarily stunned from the bang of the shot apparently forgetting that guns do that, and Signaged to trip myself. At the sound of a near-deafening roar I scrambled to my feet and booked it home at top speed. I really shouldn't be staying up this late.

I spent the entire night staring out the window trying to think of an explanation on what happened. What was that thing? Why did it sound so big? Why didn’t it attack me straight away? Was it a dragon? An escaped lion? A very lost grizzly? I really wanted to look up something, *anything* but I didn’t own a phone and the family laptop was probably made when the light bulb was. I didn’t have any patients for slow internet anyway. When the sun finally decided to rise I thought of skipping school but decided against it because my sister is . Despite feeling exhausted, I couldn’t sleep and continually found myself glancing at the windows expecting something to be staring back at me. Other than the trauma of being stalked by some unknown beast and could have possibly been the things late-night snack, the day went normally. After surviving the day my nerves eased a bit and I decided to actually get some rest and stayed home that night.

The next day was a different story with my interaction with the beast making the headlines of the local newspaper. Everything that had happened was detailed in an article that was titled THE MYSTERY OF MORRICO VALLEY. I had apparently woken up half the neighborhood with all the shooting and roaring and several people reported it. The same morning the police investigated finding a large amount of blood trailing off and disappearing into thin air with a large piece of silver jewelry containing a gemstone near the end with strange writing etched on its surface. I decided to keep the theme of not going out at night. The day after was really something with the entire thing blowing up, and appearing on every media platform ever imaginable. They did several tests on the blood finding it didn't match any species, and the language was completely foreign to all the experts on the subject. I had hit something and half the world wanted to know what it was.

In the coming days, the media was flooded with theories about the Morrico Valley Mystery as the internet called it. Everything from aliens to lizardmen, to the apocalypse, it was all there. I started doing some research and it was almost all the same "Are the Lizard Men Real" and "Signs of the Apocalypse". I did find some stuff on dinosaurs and mutation which didn't have anything that I already thought of and didn't incorporate the gemstone well into the theory. I didn't speak to anyone about my connection to the event, although I was tempted to brag to my peers at school after my paranoia had died down. Now all I needed to do was wait until the whole thing blew over.

A few days after the story blew up I walked down the stairs for breakfast, I looked down at the table, surprisingly, to find my sister already there munching on some off-brand cereal my mom buys.

“What are you doing up so early?”

She quickly responds with “School field trip.” and continues to eat her cereal like I wasn’t there. I got myself some eggs and sausages that my dad had already made and headed to the table shooting my sister a face. As soon as I sit down my sister passes me the comics like she was some sort of movie spy.

“Here.”

“Seriously. This is from yesterday, I already read this.”

“Well, I thought you hadn't, you don’t have to be rude about it.”

This time she was the one shooting faces.

She went back to her cereal so I rolled my eyes and skeptically opened the comics to find the original article “THE MYSTERY OF MORRICO VALLEY” plastered on the front. I almost choked on my egg.

Trying to cover up my shock I questioned her.

“Wait, why is this here, I thought I threw this away.”

Out of the corner of my eye, I swear I saw her cover up a smile.

“Oh, I thought it would be useful for an essay or something, it must have gotten mixed up with all the comics.”

She punctuated her explanation with a smug grin, and plucked it from comics, and crumpled it up. I’m pretty sure my sister is on to me.

It had been two weeks since I had been to my hideout and my mental state seems to slowly deteriorate. School has become more and more unbearable and everything in the universe was stopping me from, extra homework, family coming over, FBI and scientist investigations in the area, my paranoia, it was getting ridiculous. On top of the Morrico Valley Mystery seemed to be picking up steam instead of blowing out. This thing had books, documentaries, and even a few memes under its belt. Then it stopped, in a matter of days the entire thing was seen as a hoax or history and the internet moved on, even the investigations stopped.

Finally. I was overflowing with excitement when the day came. No extra homework, no fear, no family, I just wanted to get back to normal. I was on super speed when I was able to get out of the house. Grabbing the bag with all my stuff, deciding to pack some extra snacks, today was a good day. I wasted no time, almost sprinting the whole way, arriving, I threw down my bag and quickly got into the VR suit which probably needed to be cleaned, but I decided to wait. Upon logging in I was met with thousands of notifications from friends and apps prodding and asking where I was. I marked all of them as read and entered a chat room with my friends. I was instantly hit with a wave of greetings and questions from all over the world. It was good to be back.

The crack in the earth gave way to a small alcove scattered with green tongue shrubs and wiltwinds. There were several patches of long (Wheat like) plants that seemed to sprout out of the sandstone. They grew in thicker and thicker patches as he walked through the rift. Strangely, the red and brown volcanic stone of the desert gave way to the blueish gray of (granite). The pale yellow shoots seemed to prefer it, bunching in rifts or regular splits in the stone. By the time he reached the shallow end, the (granite) formed short pillars wreathed in billows of dark green. Starlight flowed in with a (small) stream. Pattering(...) He rounded the corner and froze. A massive (shape) of midnight black rested on a cluster of (granite) pillars, perfectly silent. This had to be a hallucination, yet he couldn't look away. Some small part of him pleaded for him to flee, to protect him from whatever thus was. But he had been chasing for the impossible and it was sleeping right in front of him. He was not ready. 
(Sand chaf) was growing in a thick blanket below the creature. He could see the strange plant roots growing into the stone and splitting it into gravel. Swaying in an invisible breeze, the (sand chafe) bunched against the void of the creature. 
The thing was so dark it was as if someone had cut out the shape of it in an editing software and colored it pure black. It shifted in its bed of plants, and he flinched. It continued to slumber silently, but the movement revealed it had a coat of fur, or maybe feathers that would briefly reflect light in swirls of muted yellows, and pale browns. 
As soon as he saw the strange thing, a pure darkness flooded the shadows. Then the starlight faltered, and an icy cold pressed against him. In moments the world was empty of everything except him and this terrible unreality. Its eyes where still closed, yet he knew. It knows I'm here. 
its eyes like suns bore into him. A burning light flooded the alcove. The beams of starlight vanished, replaced with blinding white heat. Without thinking he fled, the light seemed to focus on him for a brief moment and then faded. He didn't stop running til he reached his house.

Conner and samantha have to get something from the local conspiracy theorist
Theorist: I don't believe everything the government says!
Samantha: we’re the ones who told the government!!!!!

“I don’t call someone a wizard for having one weird thing about them or an odd object they own, I call someone a wizard because they have an attic filled with mysterious objects and probably forbidden knowledge hidden in their attic.” 
“what are you talking about, everyone has mysterious and forgotten stuff in their attics.” 
“I don’t know who you are hanging out with because I definitely do not.” 
"well, he's weird, right..."
"he's a scientist, not a magician. this guy seems serious." 
"wizards can be serious..." 
"really."
"really... the cool ones at least"
"they sell lies for a living, magic isn't real"
"yes i guess but like, its not *just* fake..."
"Are you talking about those stories about reincarnation?"
"i guess..."
