>The planes glinted in the low light of a blue-white saffire sun, a blinding point near the horizon. The atmosphere on the surface was cold, thin, poor in oxygen- the sky above thick with clouds of stars in one direction, almost empty in the other.


There was something, beyond being unsettling, about circular pupils. So much personality was shown in the shape of a species eyes, the eagerness of the ()s horizontal pupils, the strange w shape of the (), the h shape of the (), even the vertical slits of the ()s warned of their history of hunters, which the hominids and dragons with their seemingly uncountable variations, had in common. The two species had eyes that were remarkably like gemstones, the perfectly cut and polished rings, the center of each a void, with infinite symmetry, a perfect circle.. The circle was the most basic shape, a form of elementary math, to see it inset into biology was so alien. This property gave both species the remarkable ability to create Bindings by sight alone, these Bindings can be broken easier than most, but can be made instantly and accurately with enough intuition. The hominids are excellent at projectile calculation and the dragons are unmatched in plasma manipulation, and both glean extra information from their sight that is difficult to describe, identifying a quality of light beyond polarization and brightness, I've heard it described as the harmonies of light.

Description of alien vegas
It was as if some self respecting town had gotten lost in the desert and laid down to die, and instead of eating it, the scavengers and thieves built strange attractions in hope to draw in more meat for their hunger
There was literally nothing out there but dust. It was so dry and hot I almost expected to see pair of skull and bones sticking out of the landscape, but even death seemed to avoid this place. The longer I stared at the barren hills the more I was convinced that this was some alien world and not my home valley. The only solace was the bitter air that should have been unbreathable but was instead just barely palatable.

You’d think that knowing the exact day of your death would change how you view the world. Yet despite that fact, I thought like everyone else as death stares down at me, not much really. You don't think about it unless you are getting existential or suicidal. The future is never here, even when we choose to use our time to think of the future, it is always divorced from our lives. The future is not a destination but a part of how we define the path we take through time, knowing how long the trail is only narrows down where you can end up by so much, besides most people know they are probably going to die in their mid 40's anyways.

Truth is a Journey
the path is here, under our feet as we walk it, we can think of the twists before they come, but the path is still here as we travel, our movement so intimately connected to the structure of it that they are bound together, the road guiding the traveler shaping its actions, and the traveler creating the road, wearing it down so it persists
to travel is an ancient and divine act, the manifestation of life's goal to spread and thrive in all places

- Make rough draft of Terran language tree and write about an alien scholar documenting it
Terra was threatening to break my passion for languages. As I looked down at another failed grammar tree, I contemplated zeroing the whole project and claiming that Terra was somehow the only planet with Sign manipulating cultures that hadn't developed language. maybe I could blame it on the obscene amount of Signa radiation constantly hitting the planet, or those giant lizards...

he closed his eyes allowed his senses to drift off too... somewhere else. an impenetrable dark descended upon him, swallowing everything, smothering his senses. Balance, sight, touch, smell and taste, all replaced with the a truer shape of his immediate surroundings, his mind became a bead he could move however he wanted through the weave of all things

It heard the satisfying *clink-clunk* as the male end of the cord connected with the heavy duty cover of the panels female end. The machinery hummed to its approximation of homeostasis, lights flashing patterns that only the literate in 500 years of lost languages would be able to parse, the many flywheels spinning up to blinding speeds, motors warmed their joints as it gave the command to initiate the boarding sequence.

- "If I where one of my ancestors, I would have said you where a messenger of the gods."
- leviathan... thats an interesting word, its the name of the only thing I've seen that makes dragons consistently scared shitless
- Ritual combat!?!  That has been dead for centuries!"
