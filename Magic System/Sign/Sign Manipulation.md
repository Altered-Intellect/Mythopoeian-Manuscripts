# [[The Three Voices]] 
the [[Sign]] that allows [[Life]] to use [[Sign Manipulation]] through [[Language]]
how true names are spoken, the songs of the universe are sung, and how holy scriptures can be truly recited 
The art of the three-fold soul
- all words spoken with the second voice, resonate with everything, but will resonate more with things that are more similar to the ideal the word conveying 
## [[Voice of Structure]]
[[#Subject]] of sapience, medium of [[Culture]]
The first voice of structure, it is what is used in communication and expressing intention, it's how we use language and perform action, it guides and is shaped by thought
- always has a physical medium but can be spoken, gestured, written, ect.

## [[Voice of Silence]]
[[#Signifier]] of sentience, medium of the [[Soul]]
the third voice does not speak, it is the silent voice, the space between thoughts, the moment of now without intention, it is the center and where the [[#Soul]] lies, the "I am" at the center of experience 
## [[Voice of the Sign]]
[[#Signified]] of consciousness, medium of the [[Sign]]
The second voice is the alignment of the silence and the structure, an understanding of each voice through the other, the union through a sign, its the voice that travels using the medium of [[Signa]], a "second voice" the first being the voice of structure
