# [[Metasign]]
contains the sign and its [[#Inverse Sign]], and their [[#Perpendicular Sign]], the sign acts as the [[System]], the inverse acts as the signifier and the perpendicular acts as the signified
metasigns allow bindings to self reference and intersect in complex ways giving rise to drastically more information dense [[Binding]](s)
between minds as consciousness can be used as both a [[System]] and [[Signifier]]
- System/Signifier metasigns act on the logical structure of a the [[Sign-System]]
- System/Signified metasigns act on the material properties of the [[Sign-System]]
- Signified/Signifier metasigns acts on the comprehension of communication such as with [[Culture]] and 
Metasigns can also interact with an individual component of a sign, affecting the system, signifier, or signified without affecting the others.

## [[Inverse Sign]]
the sign that is opposite to one of the properties, 
the number of inverse signs is related to the amount of information in the system that the sign encodes, an inverse sign will always have the same complexity i.e. [[Information density]].

## [[Perpendicular Sign]]
the sign that is perpendicular according to some concept that binds two signs together, the union of a sign and its opposite, a perpendicular will always be more or less complex than the [[Sign]] and its inverse, never equally complex
Given a Sign A and a Sign B, the perpendicular Sign C will be with the [[Sign-System]] that includes all properties that are common between Sign A and B. For example, the perpendicular sign of black and white is the sign of brightness

# [[World Sign]]
the [[Sign]] formed from a [[Celestial Bodies]], they are slower than other forms of signs, take the form of large fractal structures within the [[Complex Plane]]. the world sign has a cycle of energy entropy and emergence that is specific to that worlds composition, orbit, and position within its celestial system
each world accumulates [[Signa]] as it grows larger, which then settles into a configuration based off of the properties of the world
the Signa will create a [[Sign-System]] unique to that world
- Gas Giants seem to be more dynamic with their shifting atmosphere and electromagnetic fields, but many tectonically active planets are also dynamic.
- each world has a unique way that [[Signa]] behaves, signa changes when bound to a system, then the same is true for a celestial object, because if this, each world has its own local laws of semantics and semiotics that affect the laws of physics, each [[World Tree]] has a unique structure, and each system has a harmony in which each body in the system 
- The medium of the [[World Tree]](s)
## [World Mantle]
The result of an intersection of the Electromagnetic and [[Signa Field]] that is generated from a world 
- the world mantle is most prominent in gaseous worlds and rocky worlds with active tectonic activity
## [[World Scar]]
the result of a break in a [[World Sign]], are often made when a [[Planetoid]] is hit by a another similarly sized [[Object]]
