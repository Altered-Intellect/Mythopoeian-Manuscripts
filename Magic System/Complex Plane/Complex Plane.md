# Complex Properties
the unique properties of 
- things that repeat represented by heavy and solid things, rituals are represented by metals
- single actions behave like light, photons on the atomic scale and beams or auras on the macro scale
- mechanism that creates [[lightweave]] 
- the more [[Signa]] is bound to a system the further that system can travel into the complex plane
- there is a limit to how far certain elements can go into the complex plane (if you force it all of the hydrogen gets ripped from your body and then scattered across the universe via the interplanar medium) 
- the more mass something has the more energy it takes to move it, alpha radiation and hydrogen move the easiest element through the complex plane, 
- the entirety of the complex plane is rotating, making the the location of mundane reality within the complex plane change overtime, this rotation appears as the movement of Signa

### [[Complex Temperature]]
if temp is defined as particle movement, then complex temp is particle movement within the complex plane
- this allows temp to go to absolute zero
- can create substances that act like black holes for temp, absorbing heat without growing hotter, requiring that the material is at absolute zero and is shunting the energy into the complex plane 
#### [[Harmonic Phase Matter]]
an alchemical state of matter created when regular temp a complex temp resonate with each other
- has unique properties because its movement creates a "ring" that can be used in a sign, allowing [[Sign Manipulation]] at the atomic level
- metals harmonic phase makes their [[Elemental Property]] completely energy efficient 
### Complex Mass
### Complex Charge
#### Complex Electromagnetism
changes in both the electric and magnetic fields rotated into the complex plane, this gives electromagnetism another vector in its field, perpendicular to the other two, making the system act like the dimensions of space
- gives light a property analogue to mass allowing it to move at sub causal speeds, this is the mechanism used in the creation of [Lightweave] 
#### Complex Space
acts as a perpendicular dimension of time and a measure of distance between concepts
acts like a fourth dimension of space the exponentially diminishes in size the further you travel from the mundane plane 
an area that is bound to Signa physical space is created, for every square unit of space that a particle of Signa is bound to [e^-x] units of space are stretched out into in the complex plane, this means if you travel a unit of distance into the complex plane, the amount of space gets reduced by one third,
If enough Signa is in an area of the complex plane, it will start affecting the other dimensions of space and time, allowing for wormholes
the more Signa is in a section of space, the more that space is affected by the complex plane
- the amount of space a [[Signa Particle]] can bind to is dependent on its total energy, because the [[Inter-Planar Medium]] is filled with mostly high energy particles, a large fraction of empty space is rotated into the [[Complex Plane]], almost doubling the density of the universe from five hydrogen atoms per meter cubed, to nine hydrogen atoms  
- time passes differently across the [[Complex Plane]] depending on the orientation of the object with 
- depending on the place where you are in a realm, the sun will appear as a pillar or arc in the sky, stars will be like wisps of shifting smoke, the moon fractured into its many phases
- events in the past can affect multiple events in the future
- allow events to happen in parallel with each other giving rise to closed [[Time Loop]](s)
