inhabited exclusively by spirits, forming an ecosystem of bindings
It is a realm that is “below” ours in a sense, as things that happen in the real world directly affect the spirit realm in what types of life can thrive.
It is a place where things from mundane reality are represented. The more complex something is in the real world, the more complex something will be in the spirit realm. The laws of physics are not the same however and this gives rise to impossible landscapes and unique settings.
- spirits can form from complex use of energy that living things disperse, the appearance of these spirits reflect how the energy is used, with the most influence originating from the metabolism of the living being (ATP appears like smoke and embers, plant like

[[Realm]](s) that have a spatial dimension
## [Realm of the Eclipse]
- exclusionary realm of [[Sol]], connects all eclipses and midnights into a single "place". It is the earth and Theia without the sun, a cold a desolate realm without light. The only heat coming from the earth itself. The moon hangs in a single place in the sky without its halo, always a broken ring when not an eclipse 
## [Elsewhere Wood]
the place where lost things go, a place of crumpled spacetime, folded and creased into a mess of extra dimensional geometry, most naturally occurring creases or tears in space time have their origin in these woods making them a dangerous place to be without preparation and knowledge of what ends up in them. at the center is [The Folding Tree], its branches and root systems reach an impossible amount of worlds, connecting them together through the woods 
### [Backwoods of Creation]

## [Cosmic cave]
also called the Cosmic caverns, a representation of the cosmos as a cave system with deep winding paths of embedded in dense impassable stone [[Celestial Stone]], almost opaque but completely black, stars rest in its veins mimicking the structure of the universe, the paths are impossibly long and end in small caverns with a stone arch allowing passage back into the physical part of the universe.
## [Galactic Forest]
