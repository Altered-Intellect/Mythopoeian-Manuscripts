# [Material Plane]
the planes of the [[System]], "mundane" reality
## [Elemental Plane]
overlap between the [[#Structural Realms]] and the [[#Subjective Realms]]
there are planes for each element of the periodic table, you can't enter an elemental plane as its more of an abstraction of logic, but they an be interacted with and drawn upon, drawing upon the plane of iron will allow a person to manipulate iron, summoning it from a distance using spatial-temporal bindings, changing its temp, it interactions with the electromagnetic field, and how it is perceived 
Molecular planes form at the intersection between two or more elemental planes, a molecular plane forms for the resulting molecules 
life can use elemental planes, projecting the properties of the element onto the Signa in their bodies 
- an animal with iron in its blood can draw on the elemental plane of iron, as iron makes up apart of the their body, people with [[Sign Manipulation]] can use nearby iron to make the [[Signa]] in their body have similar properties, skin becomes like steel but can rust away
- the easiest to access by life is water 
## [Spatial Plane]
## [Temporal Plane]
## [Inertial Plane]
## [Energetic Plane]
## [Electromagnetic Plane]
overlap between the [[Cognitive Plane]] and the [Material Plane]
# [Structural Plane]
 realms of the [[Signified]], the ideals that exist as a product of the mundane realm
## [[Spirit]]

## [[Dreaming]]
overlap between the [Cognitive Realm] and [Structural Realm]
a section of the cognitive realm that dedicated to the dreams and nightmares of living things, where dreams are represented take place is a realm defined by the thoughts of different species, interacts with the complex plane and bindings
in Bone the mystic dreaming that is shown in the comic gives people super-human abilities such as strength, durability, and precision in combat
- using the nervous system as a way to increase strength, precision in movement, and durability, perfecting the way [[Intent]] moves through body
- dreaming falls under mental movement(?)
## [Mathematic Plane]
(N/P)
section of the cognitive plane where logical structure is represented in pure bindings, the size of 
- lots of infinite fractals, patterns, or structure 
- 
# [[Cognitive Plane]]
a planes of the [[#Signifier]], the mind space
When beings from [Material Plane] are projected as shades, they cause the world around them to change because of how they view it
- Concepts make up the “matter” in the cognitive plane, words become objects, perspectives interlock to become the environment
- Laws become barriers, often in the form of walls or rifts in the cognitive plane, the more the law becomes reinforced social norms and values, and communication technology, the harder those walls become to cross.
