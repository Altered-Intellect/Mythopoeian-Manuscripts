dreaming is a property that all life possesses, anything that lives must interact with the plane of dreams to keep its existence intact, otherwise it would stagnate and become devoid of a cohesive identity

[[Spirit]]s are unable to dream in the same way the life is able to as they are never unconscious, instead they are in a third state of conscious experience that forms the barrier between the conscious and unconscious
