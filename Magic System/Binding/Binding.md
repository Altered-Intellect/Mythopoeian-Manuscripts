# [[Field Binding]]
## [[Energetic Binding]]
bindings that sustain themselves through a constant input of lower entropy/concentrated energy from outside the system. these bindings are the most common and most unstable as energy is everywhere and constantly shifting in its flow.

## [[Spatial-Temporal Binding]]
bindings that deforms space and time by linking directly to the fabric of space time or increasing or decreasing the energy-mass content in a given area of spacetime, changing it effect on it
- can be used to teleport, using time or the [[Complex Plane]] as a fourth dimension to travel through
- transfer the weight of a system to another
- slowing time relative to a system
- see the full duration of a system, ie prophecy, fore-sight
- create both positive and negative gravitational fields

## [[Electric-Magnetic Binding]]
bindings that affect electromagnetism and its field
- create mono poles
- cause metals to emit light 
- bend and shape electromagnetic fields, affecting radiation and matter
- room temp superconductor

## [[Nuclear Force Binding]]
Bindings that affect the strong and weak nuclear forces 
- Break or form unstable atomic bonds
- Manipulate chemical reactions
- Accelerate or decelerate atomic decay
- manipulate temperature (?)
## [[Spirit Binding]]
binding that can trap, store, and manipulate spirits using [asymmetric] bindings to connect a living being to a spirit, a spirit binding needs an object to use as the [[Subject]]
this process allows the bound spirit to share its properties with a biological being, providing a way to obtain magical abilities, there are three different types of spirit binding, [[Dominion]], [[Contractual]], and [[Enchantment]]
Some ideas for abilities that spirits have:
-   obtain the knowledge and skill related to the spirit (navigate a forest, reference material in a book, manipulate a material)
-   obtain the abilities and properties of the spirit
-   ability to consume magical bindings or spirits and turn it into energy
-   convey the true name of something
-   ability to alter magic circles
### [[Dominion]]
a destructive spirit binding
either the person or the spirit must be unwilling to make the binding as then it would be a [[#Contractual]] binding. 
doing this you must wrangle a spirit and then bind it onto you. a person is put in a magically induced coma usually in a temple. The persons [[#Souls|soul]] enters the [[Spirit Realm]] as a [[#Shades|shade]] and they must wrestle the spirit into their body. The temple is used as a beacon so the souls of its inhabitants don’t get lost. Spirits come in a wide variety of types and the abilities they give is also just as varied but directly relate to the spirit it comes from. The spirit of a repetitive tasks, if used, will give the person knowledge and ability to do that task. The more complex a spirit is, the more complex abilities the wrestler gets if they succeed in binding it, and the easier it is for the spirit to trick or overpower and win. If a spirit wins the wrestle, the bindings is still made, but the spirit chooses the parameters of the binding, instead of the initiator, this often leads to the collapse of the binding, but with spirits that are complex enough, the spirit will choose rule the initiator will reject so they become the unwilling party. 
the nature of the spirit often gets irrevocably changed by the binding as they are acting as an anchor between two completely different systems with sometimes wildly different properties. 
### [[Contractual]] 
a constructive spirit binding that is an agreement between both the [[Spirit]] and the system it is linked to. 
- Warlocks use it to gain specified sign-system manipulation, how [[Half-Spirit]](s) are tamed and how Deities commune through prayer and worship.
- if a person makes a contractual agreement with a deity with ties to a biosphere, force or nature, or behavior, the person gains an awareness of the [[Subject]] the [[Spirit]] is bound to
- instead of drawing power from a natural spirit, people can choose to form a contratual binding with a persons [[Familiar]]. In exchange, they can scry on your adventures and can send telepathic messages to you, as well as make requests. It can get annoying, but you make it work.
### [[Enchantment]]
a neutral spirit binding. this is used to give the system or object the properties and abilities that the [[Spirit]] has, an object must be enchanted when both parties are unwilling to make the bond and use the spirit as a tool, thus enchantment usually make weapons of terrible destruction
- these bindings are very unstable and use up quite a bit of energy
- taking the mass-energy of a spirit and compressing it into the size of a single object often has disastrous effects   
- swords with enchantments or formed from Bindings don’t stain with blood  
- Making a flaming sword through enchanting it with a fire spirit vs, binding the fire, suspending it within the complex plane, the output is similar, but the process is different and requires different knowledge

## [[Planar Binding]]
link a [[System]] to one or more [[Realm]](s)

When something from one realm enters another, all the rules for other realms collapse at the speed of causality for that realm from the origin of the binding, these collapses often form particles or disturbances in electromagnetic, or gravitational fields 
### [[Elemental Field Binding]]
a binding that allows the input on energy and outputs a field that attracts or repels a specific element, most effective on noble gasses and nonreactive elements but at high enough energies can manipulate any element
- Supercritical fluids, when bound, make up a field of the material, energy fluctuations in the field produce particles entirely made of [[Signa]], which behave exactly like the base element with much less energy
