A System of Semiotics - a semiotic process that interacts with the [[Signa Field]] creating a [[Sign-System]] that acts upon the universe in a set of defined ways.

The magic system of this universe is structured around three central ideas, [[Sign]](s), [[Binding]](s) and the [[Signa Field]]

# The [[Sign]]
the trifecta of magic
The idea of the sign comes from a division of real world science called semiotics. This branch of science at its surface deals with the fundamentals of meaning in communication. At its most technical it is about how we interpret the world. It is how we impart meaning onto symbols and its mechanics are used to explain complex things like language and culture. 
Semiotics studies the process in which meaning is created, called [[Semiosis]]. This concept, the process of semiosis, the "structure of meaning" is the fundamental structure of this magic system. 

## [[Semiosis]] 
the process of communication through medium of [[Life]]
involves any process that includes a [[Sign]], it does not require language, but because [[Signa]] is structured using knowledge and meaning, language becomes a very valuable tool. Semiosis has three components, the [[System]], the [[Signifier]], and the [[Signified]]. Each of these components play apart in the process of semiosis and define the properties a sign has.

### [[System]]
in semiotics, the system is called the subject, but for clarity in distinguishing terms I will be referring to the subject as the [[System]], it is the definition given to the sign, a physical object, an abstract concept, an emotion, a condition, anything that a word can be put to. The subject can also include [[Sign-System]](s), and [[Binding]](s) although this produces [[Metasign]](s)
Related terms : (thesis, body, concept, action, doing)
- a system of objects independent of the [[Sign]](s) or [[Binding]](s) linking them together
- it is what the sign refers to, it is the physical thing, the concept, the action that the sign represents, without this the sign has no substance, it is simply an abstract pattern, a way of law without its subject.
-  the object or system that is being referred to, it could be anything as long as it can be perceived and named
- the fractal nature of physics and its laws
### [[Signified]] 
the meaning or idea expressed by a sign, as distinct from the physical form in which it is expressed, it is what happens in the mind when the [[Sign]] is read, the understanding of meaning, without this the sign doesn’t mean anything. 
Related terms : (synthesis, spirit, understanding, flow, feeling)
- the mental connection made between the [[System]] and the [[Signifier]], the association between a word and its meaning, the mental image and what it depicts
- the patterns that exist in the world, the emergence from the laws of physics, the anthropic principle as a force of nature
- The stronger the understanding, the stronger the interaction between the [[Sign-System]] and the [[Signa Field]].

### [[Signifier]] 
This is the simplest but often the most important part of the [[Sign]], it is the image, the writing, the song, the speech, the representation that the Sign uses to communicate its structure. What the representation is made of affects how the [[Sign]] is read. 
Related terms : (antithesis, mind, medium, movement, thinking)
- the symbol used to describe the object or system, it could be a spoken word, a phrase, a gesture, a piece of art, it only needs to convey meaning
- Imitation, symbolism, rhyming, and medium all affect how a being may read the sign, and how they might express the sign.

# The [[Binding]]
the intersection between two or more [[Sign-System]](s). It is the most simplistic interaction between two [[Sign]](s) making them act as a distinct whole, a link between two or more [[System]](s) using Signa fields, it is the language that [[Sign]](s) uses to operate

# The [[Signa Field]]

a permeable field like space-time or the electromagnetic field. It is the medium of information. Its carrier particle, the [[Lekton]], is the basis to any [[Sign-System]]. It interacts with all other laws of physics altering how energy, entropy, and emergence behave, Signa binds to how information in the universe is structured,
## [[Signa]]
the substance of magic, it is the group of particles that act as the physical mechanisms of [[Binding]](s), [[Sign]](s), and [[Realm]](s).
### [[Ikon]]
Signa-Particle Binding
[[Signa]] bound to [[Sign-System]](s) when not bound to another particle or field, including itself, it has no properties and instantly decays into energy, are only stable within [[Binding]](s), [[Sign]](s) and other Sign-Systems.
### [[Psynon]]
Signa-Field Binding 
[[Signa]] bound to a field will adopt properties based on the particle or waveform and will gain specific behaviors depending on the properties of that field. Signa will decay into the fundamental particles of that field
Signa particle changes properties with the information it is bound to, It is extremely stable and evenly distributes itself in a given area, it's everywhere at any given time but the concentration can vary based on the particles it is interacting with
it can change one form of energy into another, Ie. absorbing energy in the form of heat and then releasing it in the form of radiation or an electromagnetic field, these transfers are not always 100% efficient and will cause excitations in other fields, or will transfer energy into nearby particles
Signa when bound a field, it tends to spread out, allowing the density to match the amount of energy-mass content in the area.
Energy can be stored in the bonds between Signa and other particles, the amount of energy a Signa bond can hold is dependent on the energy-mass content of the system it is bound to

### [[Lekton]]
Signa-Signa Binding
[[Signa]] in it purest form, a particle that is only bound to other Signa. Like all mundane particles it is a topological disturbances in its field, it is a fundamental particle and is the force carrier for the [[Signa Field]]

# [[Sign-System]]
A [[System]] that includes a [[Sign]] - a set of information that can be defined and separated from the rest of the wider universe via the semiotic properties of the [[Signa Field]]

[[Sign-System]](s) with higher concentrations of structural bindings require more work and [[Signa]] to change, systems with [[Energetic]] bindings are more sensitive to change, requiring less work to start reactions and less energy to keep them going

some signs and bindings have a tenancy to consume large amount of energy and rapidly lowering entropy or increasing enthalpy, often killing people who do not use them carefully, the [[Inter-Planar Medium]] is extremely
[[Sign-System]](s) are used in the structure of [[Binding]](s), a property of magic that links two or more [[System]](s) together. 

the physical mechanism of Bindings is the [[Signa Field]].

- centered around an observer
- becomes much more complex when interacting with living things as the ability to communicate with their surroundings allows information and bindings to be derives from the qualities of the [[Sign-System]]

# [[Complex Plane]]
mundane reality can be split into four main forces gravity, electromagnetism, the strong force and the weak force, in [[Mythopoeia]], these forces form "planes" of reality, the complex plane is a fifth plane to reality that is formed from the properties of [[Signa]] and [[Binding]],
[[Life]] affects the complex plane even without energy in [[Signa Field]], the higher density the closer the bond [[Spirit Realm]] has with the physical thus increasing the amount of Signa that can exist in an area  

When an objects contained another system, that system is embedded with an amount of Signa and rotated into the complex plane, this allows [[Spirit]](s) to sense and interact this new system in unique ways

## [[Planar Field]]
the interactions of the different planes of existence
## [[Inter-Planar Medium]]
medium of extremely Signa dense, high energy electrons, alpha, beta and gamma radiation that makes up 96% of the mass-energy content of the [[Complex Plane]]
- in the "cooler" parts of the medium, super heated hydrogen gas forms that is often used to power many advanced stellar-level cultures and their technology
- useful for when you need a lot of energy, much less useful when you need control... many people have blown themselves apart trying to use this 

## [[Realm]]
intersection between two or more properties within the [[Complex Plane]] that are a defined by the system that [[Signa]] is bound too, a type of [[Sign]] using a [[Planar Binding]]
realms can not be entered without the set of rules that define the realm contain a spatial-temporal binding and can not be interacted with at all without a cognition binding or and external anchor such as a [[Spirit]].
Are result of the [[Complex Plane]] and how it interacts with the rest of the universe
complex plane can connect different aspects of mundane reality
- Realms that are bound to both time and space, have the same temporal properties of the complex plane, can connect two places in time, thus creating [[Wormhole]](s)
- each end of a wormhole are a set distance away from each other and can not move toward or away from each other, because of this wormholes are often moving very fast comparatively to other surrounding space 
- Realms can be interacted with with signs and Signa circles, 
- all realms have a set "distance" from another depending on how different the [[Sign-System]](s) are that define it are, the realm for ice is directly connected to the realm of water by the fact that they are both phase states of the same molecule
in the same way that a [[Binding]] is the intersection between two or more [[Sign]](s), a [[Realm]] is the intersection between two or more [[Planar Field]](s)
how a realm is interacted with is dependent on the [[#Bindings]] used to interact with it
