denoted with the symbol [Ñ°]
- have no angular momentum/spin, no mass and no charge, only being made of [[Superlative Energy]]
- are created by patterns, fractals, and logic but have asymptotic limits to how much a [[Sign-System]] can hold
- All elementary particles have three properties, charge, mass, and spin, the behavior of Signa is dependent on what properties of the particle its bound to
