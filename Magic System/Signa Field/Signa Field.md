### [Meta Interaction]
the interactions between the types of [[Signa particle]](s) are how [[Binding]](s) form
Signa-energy interactions store the energy that they are bound to preventing it from being either a potential or kinetic state 
the properties the material has, converting it into [[Superlative Energy]]

this density is tied to the "probability"
- Signa has a particle-wave duality, thus the probability that a Signa particle will affect the [[System]] that it is bound to is dependent on structure and energy-mass content of the System
- the higher the density, the higher the interactions

### [Anti-Signa]
a family of phenomena that reverse or decrease the effect of the [[Signa Field]] in a [[System]]
as [[Signa particle]](s) do not have an inherent charge, spin, or size and can be formed from both positive and negative energy, [[Signa]] can not form anti particles
- removing [[Sign Manipulation]] in a living organism requires surgery and/or the ability to create a [[Signa Void]] which requires algebraic math and precision using [Sign Circle]
- The ability to artificially break [[Analogue Binding]](s), create [[#Signa Voids]] and [[#Inverse Sign]](s) are ancient secrets in some post-collapse [[Terran Culture Tree]]
#### [[Signa Void]]
a bound area that has no energy, or "excitations" in the [[Signa Field]], effectively removing [[Signa particle]](s), and [[Binding]](s), from the area. this removes the "magical" component of [[#Signs]] creating an area that behaves almost exactly like mundane reality, this doesn't completely remove the influence of the Signa field as it can still interact with mundane physics even when it is has no energy in very specific circumstances (absolute zero and magnetic monopoles can still be achieved for instance) 
quasi-particles form in any Signa saturated matter that is under its maximum Signa capacity, they key is to make those quasi-particles interact to create a void of Signa within the matter. This void can be grown and shaped by extracting Signa from the material and manipulating the shape and topology of the void
- Life on bodies within [[Signa Void]](s) are unable to develop [[Sign Manipulation]]

## [[Signa Phase State]]
>"It is our duty to spiritualize the periodic table." - Crypotheism

When [[Signa]] binds to atoms in a specific range of ratios it will undergo a special phase transition that will alter the matter's properties. This transition requires varying levels of Signa for each element, and often only happens in specific temperature or pressure ranges, and electromagnetic radiation levels. The structure of the element and the Signa need to harmonize
- The transitions only effects the ions of Nobel gasses not their stable forms, which makes the Signa Phase State of Noble gasses virtually impossible to create naturally
- Most transition metals only undergo a phase transition in the presence of an electromagnetic field

Each element has three metrics that have to do with how Signa interacts with the element
- Retention : how much Signa can be bound to a set quantity of the element, this is determined by mass and electron orbitals
- Attraction : how well Signa binds to the element, a positive number means that Signa is attracted to it, negative is the opposite
- Property : the change in the properties of the element, each element gains an extra property, which is a "logic statement" that describes it

### [[Temporal Ring]]
sections of space time that have been folded into a self contained loop, these loops contain event horizons that prevent outside influence, rings of spacetime, giving matter the means to travel back in time
