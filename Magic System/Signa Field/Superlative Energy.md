a third state that energy can enter when bound to [[Signa]], it can only interact with itself. it is extremely unstable decaying into normal energy which disperses into the local environment due to entropy. Because it can only interact with itself it tends to bunch up in areas creating hot-spots of volatile energy and reversing entropy in the environment where it is located.
because [[Signa]] always forms [[Binding]](s), the presence of Signa in a [[System]] limits the increase on entropy and can reverse it as they can restrict how many disordered states and increase the amount of ordered states there are, this is because bindings prefer to form around patterns and fractals
- this reverse in entropy can also make negative mass, energy, and forces
- Entropy reversal can be used in more complex ways when paired with materials, machinery, or the mind
- a force that acts as a counter to entropy fueling overall complexity of the system its apart of
