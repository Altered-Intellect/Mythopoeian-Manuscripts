### [Transmutation]

- the path from one element to another might be easier by transmuting to several intermediate elements in different element groups, the quintessential example of this is the transition directly from lead to gold is extremely energy intensive and nearly impossible, but 
### [Elemental Group]
Noble gasses are the easiest element to bind properties toÂ as they give the Signa bound to them the most flexibility, this also makes Signa saturated noble gasses unstable and the Signa will often just decay into heat (this property make neon lamps as an extremely efficient tool for creating binding breakers, that transform the energy in binding directly into heat)

- Increase mass, adding energy/mass content to atomically bound Signa
- Increase density, i.e. crushing force, force atomically bound Signa to center of mass
- Decrease mass, removing energy/mass content to atomically bound Signa
- Expansion, force atomically bound Signa from center of mass
- push Signa to center of mind
#### [Gold-group metal]
Transmutation - attracts change from one state to another 
the properties of atomic-Signa bonds makes transmutation a lot easier, transmutation usually happens when a material is on the verge of Signa-phase transitioning 
gold lowers this barrier even further, as it is one of it elemental properties
- Energy conversions
	- Heat <> light
	- light <> motion
	- motion <> heat

#### [[Silver-group metal]]
Reflection - reflecting change in a system

- Reflects physical force, can only be changed using [[#Static transformations]], makes the material extremely tough
- Reflects inertia, locks material in place, can only be moved using [[#Spatial-Temporal]] bindings
- Reflects heat energy, lower temp, lower Signa, cools material 
- Reflects gravity, makes material weightless, resisting all gravitational pull
#### [Iron-group metal]
Retension - resists the change in a system
#### [Transition Metal]
Inversion - reverses the change in a system

- Inverts physical force, binds things to the surface of the material
- Inverts inertia, any mass will oscillate between rest and movement
- Inverts gravitation, materials mass is negative, it falls up instead of down

##### [Plane bridging]
When transition [[Metal]]s are doped with Signa, they become bridges that energy can pass to and from the [[Complex Plane]], mechanism is electron spin-charge to Signa binding, how far the metal can transport the energy depends on the mass of the metal the lower the mass the further the energy can travel
