## [[Terran Culture Tree]]
the cultures that have originated from [[Terra]] and its [[World Tree]]
The force of Culture has a wide reach on the world of [[Terra]] as the Cultures of Terra have their roots in many species across the planet. from spirits to space dust. The main three Cultural forces come from three species groups, the [[Hominid]]s, the [[Draconic]]s and the [[Celephalopod]]s. 

Cultural Development of [[Binding]] and [[Sign Manipulation]] throughout the history of Terra
The use of [[Signa]] follows a similar path to technology in energy usage, it starts out with using the energy from an individuals body to do simple tasks and then it slowly transfers to using more elaborate tools, using the environment as a source of work. The complexity and energy usage of theses tools and their interaction only grows larger.
Most simple [[Sign Manipulation]] uses internal energy sources to power the bindings, but more advanced spells are about using the environment and dedicated high density fuel sources for power as well as being more complex and precise

A culture with one book, all copies are connected to each other via a [[Binding]] allowing for communication across vast distances. the the binding for the spell is written into the physical binding of the books, allowing any book that is bound in a specific way to have access to the words. Changes to the book are regulated and rare, and communication is reserved for syncing rituals across cast distances as it requires a lot of ink and paper. It is a community activity to watch new sections being written, there are no authors and anyone who wants to claim authorship has there book and name forcibly removed from its record, effectively removing them from the

#### [[Currency]]

The medium of a currency is a product of the environment of a culture and its values
flats - thin regular cutouts of a material, often a metal, wood, or stone
- value determined by material and notches 
- favor manufacturing, often forming as a result of a culture switching from chips
chips - thin differently shaped cutouts of a material, can be shaped into almost anything, but are often imagery relevant to the societies religious group(s) and political figures
- moon phases
- fingers 
- usually limited to triangle to septigon
- plants (fruits, leaves, stem, )
knots - strings tied with knots denoting value, are often decorated with stones and metals
- the material and make of the rope affects the value
- often hand made, with more complex knots denoting higher value
spheres - a material encased in another material, that is smoothed into a sphere, often clear like glass or sap but can also be stone or metal, the most expensive of these spheres are almost always hollow, also a binding component but only for the hollow or the spheres with a metal coat
rings - a binding component used for trade, is always metal or stone alloy with a high metalicity
- size matches the rings of Theia
- are made of a circular wire bend into a ring with a gap between the end the same distance as the diameter of the wire, the precision is important for the bindings
coins - ya’know the thin circular thing we use in the real world, often made from hard materials such as metals or stone
- value is determined by the amount of holes and/or the type of metal that fills them, intricate indentations with valuable symbols, and/or 
shells - their properties like shape color size and weight often determine the value
- used on islands and coasts
grubs - when your main food source can be brought around with you and grown from a good hunt or forage, it pays to use these guys, the juicier the better
- kept in baskets 
- sorted by size
lichen - its shiny so it must be important, sorted by color *and* taste though there is some debate...
- rolled into mats which can be cut into, measured in the lengths of the cuttings
- clumped into balls and held together with twine or string
- evolves into "paper money", secured against counterfeit by genetically selecting for a specific strain of mushroom and moss that isn't available to the public
bones - they contain the soul, so they must be valuable, where the bone is in the body determines its value although some cultures simply use their size and weight regardless of species and shape
- tied together to make articles of clothing or jewelry
- used by [[Skeletal]]s as a way to maintain or modify their bodies
writings - when the ability to read and write is a rare gift, even simple things becomes valuable 
- poetry
- prayer
- a short letter of thanks 
- blessing 
- secret 
##### [[Currency Structure]]
how many different values a type of currency has and how they are distinguished is set by the unit of value, the direct value of the material, and the frequency that the value type is used 
linear means each unit of value is the same as the others
log means that each unit is more valuable that the previous by some unit
many cultures have several systems of currency that are used for the trade of different things (i.e. cattle is use to trade food and dowrys, shells are used for materials and debts)
alternative currencies can appear and become prevalent for many reason dependent on the various variables in a culture.
- the culture is less reliant on the primary currency, instead on trade or exploitation
- the primary currency is to highly or lowly valued, or is not seen as universally representing any and all value
- the primary currency has symbolism that is no longer considered valuable, often becoming associated with taboo or the sacred
- the alternative has symbolism that is valuable for its political, social, or religious significance

## [[Communication]]

- Tilting a head/limb up is a more universal sign of “yes” and tilting it down a sign or “no” as species with short or no necks don’t have the ability to nod or swivel their head
- it is appropriate to tell some one how you feel about them and how you view them and how they act as a sort of social greeting 
- Culture where it is common for people who are close to ask each other "how are we?" which is an invitation to discuss how each person views the other and their relationship to them as a form a small talk, eg. "how have i been to you?" "i have been thinking of (a detail about their life), do you of me?" "you have been well to me, have I?"
### [[Symbol]]

- representations of the two seasons (the falling season; summer to fall, and the rising season, winter to spring)
- the blue horse is the falling season and the red horse is the rising season
cup on a rope 
- symbolism for two things working together that are less useful put together than apart
- usually referring to the relationship between two people where one is leading on the other to cause problems and the other follows for attention
the reaping death 
- portrayed as a skeletal figure in a thin black veil, holding a sickle and chaff
the sacred vessel
- The process of learning is like the making of tea, you can only hold so much information at once so you need to boil off the facts and knowledge that is no longer useful, it is both the kindling of a flame and the filling of a vessel.
- this metaphor is used within the culture of alchemists as a tool for modeling their practices 
- attributed to the first sophist Phaedron

## [[Religion]]

- A monotheistic religion could start around a god of magic that set the status quo for the universe essentially creating it
- (S/C) That God's name is Abraxas. The God that still speaks into this world, their Words are the change we see. The structure that we can not. God wants us the learn the secrets and patterns of the universe so They can retire from Their duties as maintainer of the world. They say God is a secret keeper, it is said Their Word is as subtle as a bird song and as quiet as the butterflies breeze. But really They are a storyteller, still a Singer like anyone else, but to tell tales to all those who care to listen. To teach the few who truly want to know the workings of the universe. Then, as the last secret is given They will lay down to rest as they did after creating the world.
- Religion that thinks the world is a brain
- The congregation-council produces their own essays used in service as its prominent members are wise elders and writers
- A religion based off of personal insight shared within a community, the religion is anarchic and has few dedicated positions devoted to transcribing and reciting the stories and insight that is shared but is otherwise free to structure itself however the practitioners see fit
- A temple of monks who study a single sentence spoken by God. They are extremely friendly, easy-going, down to earth, and jovial. The sentence is revealed to be simple pun but the real joy comes from taking that joke and looking at it from different angles and putting it in new contexts. They keep this illusion of an infinitely complex text up because they think it's funny. Maybe that's part of the joke.
(S/C) by Foon
- Conclusion: God wants you to learn magic so he can retire
	1. God does not allow magic
	2. there exists magic that can threaten, wound, or otherwise spur God to act against it
	3. God allows magic if done in his name
	4. All magic stems from the divine.
	5. All attempts to work against God's will inevitably reproduce it in negative
People train their spatial awareness using blindfolds, forcing themselves to use their other senses to construct their spacial awareness
