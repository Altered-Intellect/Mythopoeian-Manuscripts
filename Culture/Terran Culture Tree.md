The Great Festival : a festival celebrating the continued operation of and changing of the government. It is celebrated by a parade led by the ambassador that is marched through the capital with a giant document of all the changes in law made in the year.

At the end of the day the parade gathers around the building celebrating till the sun sets, when the sun reaches the horizon, a ritual is started which ends with the document being signed by both the immortals.

## [[Draconic]] Cultures

When the story is told from the dragons point of view I want it to be centered around communicating a story about a society that is just waking up to massive coordination and just getting started, no major wars have happened just squabbles between nations and city-states here and there
dragons are territorial and have a familial and individual sense of land ownership, this forced dragons to spread out over the planet before humans have 

individual > familial > tribal > species

Dragons can and are usually territorial and greedy towards others, less so outside their family or clan, and only on occasion anywhere near benevolent.

In the area the both dragons and human inhabit, the cultures that arise are intertwined from actions of an individual to the myths through generations
- all dragons have an instinct for hoarding resources but what that resource is depends on the dragon, most dragons hoard food for the winter, 

### Dragon human comparisons

#### [[Language]]
- Different dragons from different factions call humans different things but are all variations of “thief” due to regional dialects but Humans on the other hand all have the same word for dragon even across cultures and languages - All dragon languages translate have a word for human that refers to them as a thief or one who steals
- some dragons nickname humans snake spotters
- In cultures where dragons interacted with complex human civilization, they nickname these humans “the ones who stare back” as a nod to the meaning of dragon translating into “one who stares”
fly also means to go
to insult also means to catch fire
time moves upward with the future in the sky and the past under the ground
instead of saying, hitting rock bottom, they say flying through distant mountains,
they have a strong sense of home
the word for city is an alternate word for home, that means something like, the communal land/house
dragons have an adverb that describes whether an action was done on the ground or in the sky

- dragons make something similar to dream catchers
- dragons spread to areas that have the most stable climates and are most comfortable, these areas are expanded with the advent of basic technology. As this happens, the land the ranges in the weather too much is seen as too wild to conquer and associated with humans
- some dragon cultures have an air of savagery and greed hidden underneath posh formal etiquette and customs
- Dragons have opposite ideas of wealth and poverty to humans (owning a lot of land doesn’t mean your rich)
- Nakedness is only acceptable if you are sexy, rich, pretty and/or have bright colorful scales, you are almost required to where clothes over dark spots
- There are several subspecies of dragon based on animals body plans or play style (raptor, alligator/crocodile, hawk, tiger) some of them are considered endangered as they are slow assimilated into the global dragon race
- One dragon clan pierces their ears when they get "married" (or rather, the partners pierce each other’s ears, with their teeth. calling someone fangless has the same flavor as "incel" in our world)
- Dragons, when they have more than one offspring the oldest will have the darker richer colors
- Dragon language changes as much as English or any human language
#### Myths and stories
- the myth of thief and the ruler, every human and dragon culture have a mythological story of a human stealing a special artifact from a dragon, the story has a million different variations and is told a millions different ways, sometimes the dragon is the good guy and its and inciting incident, sometime the human is the hero, stealing a precious artifact back, sometimes the thing stolen is the most important and the characters are almost irrelevant, this story is absolutely primordial and comes from the very real events of human stealing from dragons and is even more widespread than the storm god kills sea serpent myth that is common in real life 
#### Beliefs
- most dragons post-war don’t think of most human technology as inventions rather as something humans make as a part of their natural instincts, this includes things like cloth, weapons, structures, and tools
- Dragons have a very different idea on what counts as intelligence, most humans think that intelligence is connected to social stuff like logic, and general smarts like in science and philosophy. Most dragons however think that intelligence is tied to battle and nobility, outdoing and outsmarting/tricking your opponent and not taking the easy route. While dragon think logic are important in some capacity but they aren’t what makes a thing intelligent
- Some humans are viewed as very mysterious and mythical by some dragon cultures and vermin/pests by others Some dragons think humans are completely unintelligent while others think humans are like dumb proto-people that just don’t have civilization yet, and others think of humans are a threat or rival civilization, it depends on the culture of the dragons and what the human's influence and culture are like in the area
- Dragons think humans don’t have language and access to fire, two things that are necessary for their civilization


When dragon start interacting with humans and a common language is established dragons form views on human based off of their culture of origin and history with the humans both locally and historically
Some think humans are prey or vermin and don't deserve respect despite being sapient
some don’t like humans because we eat plants (most fruits and veggies which taste awful to them) 
some dragons put together that the ancient ruins of a long lost empire was ruled by our weapons and technology
some dragons develop an extreme respect for humans


### Language and Myths
The differences in the dragon tribes developed along with their languages. Their language affected how they adapted to their environments 
Each part of the dragon’s body symbolizes something, wings-stability, tail-trickery/deceit, jaws-power, fire-wisdom/magic.
- Dragon legends are a bit like greek myths with a heroic dragon that climbs to power and overcomes some evil mostly through overpowering it but with some trickery on the side a bit like the trials of Heracles, the stories are much more unstructured than traditional myths
- Civilization to dragons is more about status and the structure of power
- All winds lead to (dragon equivalent of Rome)

- Most dragons are very regal and prideful, and humiliation is the worst thing you can do to a dragon, most dragons put their pride in being the best at something or very skilled at what they do and on a species level, being both apex predators and have developed civilizations
- In some dragon cultures its in good taste to joke about humiliation and meekness, similar to how humans joke about being dumb and stupid
- A dragon's hoard is a reflection of their power, and is basically a dragon saying “ooh, look at how much stuff I can protect without it being stolen.” this archetype technically develops after the dragon rebellion as before humans took over dragons didn’t have hoards, they just controlled a lot of resources
- Dragons have two different slave classes, one consists of regular slaves used for hard labor, the other consists of battle-trained gladiators that have survived the gladiator arenas, treating one of these slaves terribly can result in death or serious punishment
- Dragons have invented currency, but don't use for daily transactions has it requires math, something most dragons are not patient enough for. currency is only used for keeping track of hoards and city resources
- Dragons that have committed terrible crimes or have been exiled have their magic removed, leaving a scar on their throat. This became commonplace as a punishment as you could just remove the tongue with a similar effect, and to show that they have been marked they put an artificial mark on the neck. In places where there are a lot of marked criminals their greeting toward a stranger uses magic to prevent people from meeting criminals
- Most dragons aren’t literate as most of the workforce is put into hunting, mercenaries, guards, magicians, and other hard labor. Most magic can be accomplished by speaking it making written magic obsolete in most cases
- Dragons that do write use clay tablets and write in cuneiform as they are the easiest to use with their claws.
- The dragon language is an altered form of Dovahzul that references dragon culture more in its vocabulary and grammar. All dragons speak this language with regional dialects forming throughout the continent like in America only a tiny step further.
- When dragons are flying they can’t hold their breath as breathing is tied to their wings beats like all other winged animals, this means that dragons are terrified of flying over large bodies of water because there is a good chance they will drown
- Dragons have essentially spread themselves thin, with large gathering of dragons being rare
- Dragonets often play pretend, using piles of rocks as their “hoard” this sort of behavior is very widespread and is seen as playful
- There is a distinction between older dragons and younger dragons, usually, older dragons are much more powerful as they have access to that mind magic thing but are also usually self-centered and prideful to a fault making them very easy to trick (the ones who are not very self-centered are super scary and even more ancient feeling), the younger dragon though are usually more open-minded and still have that heir of power behind them but are more self-conscious
- Like lizards and turtles, dragons don’t stop growing making ancient dragons massive
- Dragons have a bunch of legends of apocalyptic dragons as a show of how big their ego is, most of these legends are fake but there is one that is really made possible by some magic and time travel shenanigans
- There is a dragon legend that is a bit like the legend of Prometheus with instead fire being fought for by an ancient dragon but they have added on to this by saying that humans stole fire from dragons to justify the occasional human with a torch or something, this legend creates hostility toward humans that use fire, making humans fear that fire provokes dragons
- Older dragons tend to isolate themselves as overstimulation becomes a problem as their mind slows down
- Dragons like to dive for fish as a sport in shallow waters if they live near the ocean or large enough rivers
- The younger generations of dragons are more creative and inventive with magic much to the dismay of the older generation
- Dragon have made a haven for themselves especially in the upper class, this combined with their recent unification means that most dragon aren’t very resourceful and as kids aren’t very competent
- Dragons also grow up extremely fast add to this inexperience
- Dragons have forgotten the war because the dragons in power prefer to believe that dragons have always been in power while human have created detailed legends about their ancient heroes and how they lost the war
- Before the humans started killing dragons a single dragon family would usually own a large section of land and they would live in it, with each member owning or sharing a section with the others, rarely interacting with other families as it ended in less conflict and bloodshed.
- Dragons use the expression “three moons!” 
- dragons don’t think of most human technology as inventions rather as something humans make as a part of their natural instincts, this includes things like cloth, weapons, structures, and tools
- Some humans are viewed as very mysterious and mythical by some dragon cultures and vermin/pests by others depending on the human’s influence in the area
- Dragons think humans don’t have language and access to fire, two things that are necessary for civilization
- Some dragons think humans are completely unintelligent while others think humans are like dumb cavemen that just don’t have civilization yet, it depends on the culture and what the humans in the area are like
- Different dragons from different factions call humans different things but are all variations of “thief” due to regional dialects
- Dragon society was formed out of the need to unify to destroy the threat humans posed, human society started forming when we discovered how to farm instead of hunting and gathering. When humans started fighting each other for land and resources we became expansionist and developed a lust for conquering, and dragons were forced into the same ideals as the other option was death by the humans. Not all dragons were affected by humans though and there exist some pockets where the unification of dragons was not necessary, living as dragons had for millions of years.
- There is a dragon legend of a dragon who could not be burned and a burning dragon falling in love and founding a clan


### Naming Traditions

I don't have a language developed for the dragons but I want to have certain sounds associated with objects, people, or concepts

### Gender Ideals

### Courtship Ideals
relationships are seen as a type of "territory", competition is fierce but usually short
courtship is seen as calculated, serious, and essentially a business decision a sign of intelligence or a lack thereof instead of the reckless puppy love portrayed in modern human media

### Technological Level

There is no rigid monetary system as different areas have different resources that are used for trading. Dragons have discovered a proto-version of animal farming but it is seen as obsolete as most dragons will trade for food or just hunt it themselves. They are in a pre-medieval era in their species despite their lack of creativity and engineering. They have developed  crude armor and weapons that are only really used in wars/royalty as most fights happen without either. Dragons only built forts for war or as a show of power as most dwellings are carved into rock or in caves.

- Dragons like their privacy so when dragons start to work together in smaller areas, the currency that becomes valued is physical space. Soon dragons start trading land for favors or resources and then one dragon has the idea to make physical representations of the land and now you have an economy
### Common Dress Code

Covering the underbelly is a near universal etiquette though how much of the underbelly can range from culture to culture, the covering of the tail and legs is not uncommon and most cultures universally do not cover the wings for mobility outside of religious ceremonies/uniform or in fancy cultural garb.

### Cultural Heritage

cultural heritage plays a big part in the development of a young wyvern, this means there are tight-knit families but can't deal with others outside of their family. Their culture is centered around honor derived from battle and family lineage as both have to do with “magic” power in there world. Wyvern has an obsession over family lineage as in determines what abilities will have 
their role in the world. Jobs are often done by an entire family units with trade secrets and techniques of their craft passed from generation to generation. Its not uncommon for richer or more educated families to have these important bits of information of written down on clay tablets and stored somewhere safe. There is usually a dedicated scribe that is taught in the family but if no one take the job to learn to read and write a family can lose their scribe.

Common sayings:
hunt with your eyes
there is no good or evil, just kin

The dragons believe that the world is a giant dragon that is the father of the world and sacrificed himself to make the land

> Thoughts that are mutual between ~~cats~~ dragons and their people:
> 1. Yeah you're cute when you sleep but you didn't let me sleep either so I'm going to annoy you now because I'm bored. Hahah get poked, sleepy idiot.
> 2. How do you not comprehend this when I am literally staring at you. Like I understand that your brain can't understand things this nuanced but come on, how do you not get this.
> 3. I don't know if you know that what I am currently doing is an expression of affection, but that won't stop me. Knowing that I showed you that I love you is enough.
> 4. I heard a crinkly material and the sound of you chewing so I have to know what's in your mouth RIGHT FUCKING NOW.
> 5. I can't communicate with you and you can't communicate with me, so I'm just copying the tone of the sound you're making in hopes that you understand that I try.
> 6. You are doing activities beyond my comprehension, and I find this fascinating. I will never understand what the fuck you are trying to achieve here, but I am intrigued nonetheless.
> 7. Hey are you alright, you haven't done your weird thing in a while. Yeah I don't get why you do that but I know you do that when you're ok.
### Human/Dragon relationships
- The dragon/human bond is symmetrical in it benefits, humans get access to flight, fire breathing and overall power of a dragon. While dragons get access to endurance, a Swiss Army knife of tool use, smaller spaces, an actual sense of smell and overall versatility of a human
- Dragons are powerful and dangerous on an individual level while humans are not and humans are powerful and dangerous on a species wide level while dragons where not

- Because humans are smaller than dragons we have a higher vocal range and hearing than dragons do, dragons can only hear the lower half of the human vocal range, but things like whistling and high pitched screaming can’t be heard, 
- humans can’t hear as low as dragon can but it’s only the bottom quarter and usually the dragons talk loud and slow enough that the lower tones can be felt, 
- the size difference also means that humans think faster and have faster reflexes 
- There are several different factions of humans and ten times that of different dragon factions as they rule most of the continent
- Before the humans started killing dragons a single dragon family would usually own a large section of land and they would live in it, with each member owning or sharing a section with the others, arely interacting with other families as it ended in less conflict and bloodshed.
- Dragons have forgotten the war because the dragons in power prefer to believe that dragons have always been in power while human have created detailed legends about their ancient heroes and how they lost the war
- Dragons use the expression “three moons!” like in WOF and humans use the expression “by the fourth moon”
- in this story, the power difference between humans vs dragons come from the fact that humans had their access to magic severed when they where taken over in the dragon uprising, the dragon responsible was going to try and kill all humans but decided not to and instead decided to humiliate all of humanity by taking their magic and then tries and failed to make humans slaves to dragons. This dragon did this by casting a spell that wiped all knowledge of the magic language from every human’s memory and preventing them from being able to perceive the magic language. This spell was done with a live human sacrifice, comsuming the human in a fire that was used  

- Dragons thing is power, structure, and imposing competence, humans is cleverness, sympathy, and ingenuity
- The size ratio between a human and a dragon is about that of a human is about that of a house cat
- There are several different factions of humans and ten times that of different dragon factions as they rule most of the continent
- Dragons are powerful and dangerous on an individual level while humans are not and humans are powerful and dangerous on a species wide level while dragons where not

While dragon think love and sympathy are important in some capacity but they aren’t what makes a thing intelligent
- One of the things that was commonly sold was a wand of sparking, a small stone or iron rod with a bunch of magic symbols that allow the stick to produce a small intense spark what can travel a short distance, the spark easily can set cloth and wood on fire but can start a fire on most things if given the right amount of fuel. While humans can’t directly see the symbols of the wand, it is still reverse engineered and while humans can’t control the magic or perceive it directly, they still utilize it as a tool because that’s what humans do
- Some dragons hate that humans shed, others love our hair as it’s fluffy and soft to them

- Everyone loves talking about how dragons ate humans but ignores the fact did humans did just as often and far more opportunistically
- There was one dragon that had the largest hoard of gold of any dragon ever, it was so legendary that it became how humans viewed dragons as gold became something humans used to do economy and trade

Territory is one of the main things that is common among dragons
Going into X dragons territory is a phrase often said when talking about other tribes 

most dragon don’t believe humans are sapient and some don’t even think humans are sentient putting them on the same tier as monsters
