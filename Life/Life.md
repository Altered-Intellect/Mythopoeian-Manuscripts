## [[Void Ecology]]
ecology of the life that has evolved to live in the vacuum of space within celestial systems
- Planetary mimic: a carnivorous alien that terraforms whole planets into ideal habitable worlds in order to lure intelligent life into colonizing them then, when their populations have grown to sufficient size, it feeds 
- life developing on the rings of a Gas giant with the aid of exosphere and the stable but turbulent environment provided by the asteroids that are captured from the nearby belt
### [[Leviathan]]
Lovecraftian horrors beyond comprehension 
a type of life that has evolved in all 5 dimensions, in the ergosphere of [[#Dark Stars]], they eat entropy, excrete [[Superlative Energy]], and move by warping spacetime itself, life that has become highly saturated with Signa thus developing into a 4d creature
90% of leviathan species stay in the [Ergosphere], but the other 1% adapted to live in deep space, and the other 9% live in or around other celestial bodies  
- A class of organisms that make up over 90% of the biomass in the ergosphere of dark stars, who experience all of time simultaneously, Half of the species are microorganisms and they live within the biome, forming a Lovecraftian super organism (?)

### Space bacteria (N/P)
accelerate to near the speed of causality using light, live in [Stellar Atmosphere], notably in the [[Inter-Planar Medium]], feeding off of the high amount of energy through photosynthesis for gamma rays, often migrating between trojans and asteroid belts in a system to follow favorable solar winds

# [[Spirit]]
Spirits are beings formed from [Signa], structured by [Bindings], and almost exclusively interact with Signa fields in the [[Complex Plane]]. Spirits form when Signa binds to a [System] closed interactions of things. (spirit of the forest, spirit of fire, the spirit of the Ensley house) There are different types of spirits that are defined and classified by how they are made, their attributes, and how they interact with the physical realm. Spirit life thrives off of ecosystems in our realm. If a forest becomes big or old enough a spirit will grow off of it, that forest will get a spirit to represent it. The same can happen for any ecosystem, anything from a routine, to a relationship, to a storm, to a simple task. As long as it can be described as a [[system]], then a spirit can form from it. The spirit of course reflects the system it came from, a spirit that represents a city is going to be much more complex than one that represents a simple routine. The size of the system also affects the size and shape of the spirit. The spirit for the city might be a giant animal that repels invaders while the one for a routine might be a simple insect that walks a predictable path.

# [[World Tree]]
the life of a celestial body represented as a [[Spirit]] in the [[Complex Plane]] 
a [[spirit]] that represents the gene pool of all life on the planet in the form of a massive tree made of folded space time, matter energy, and signa that flow through the living biosphere of the planet. it exists through the whole lifetime of the planet, in all stages of its life simultaneously, its branches through all the worlds realms and eras, holding the world together with its roots
each branch in the tree represents the separation of one species from another, making it fractal like in nature, 
the world tree exist entirely within the Complex Plane and affects all of the realms inside of it, 
the planet is a living system with life affecting it as much as the it affects life, 
the structure of the tree at a given time is based on the gene-pool of the whole population of life
world trees are bound to their planets [[World Sign]] creating a complete system of the world
- world trees have elemental branches, "complex" branches, and genetic branches
	- elemental branches record the elemental composition of a population overtime
	- the "complex" branches record the types of [[Binding]](s) that a population has overtime
	- the genetic branch is the classical part of the tree of life in the real world, as it records the change in genetic composition overtime
- most of the rest energy-mass of a world tree is within the complex plain, its material [[System]] is all of the life within a Physics  [[World Spirit]]
### [[Terra's World Tree]]
>its bark is made of reflected light throughout its life, itâ€™s wood is a deep brown almost black with reflective indents in the grain, which is wrinkled and wavy.  You could see through it and yet it's surface seemed opaque. Simultaneously solid and ethereal, physical and metaphorical. With a dawn of realization they figured they where witnessing a True Sign, the system, signified, and signifier contained in one. This was the Erd Tree, source of all life.


### [[Nebos' World Tree]]
> a plane of some dark seamless earth, no less like heedless stone stretched from the very foundations of the world to its horizon, each ridge in its surface a sign engraved with it binding, the true source of the unkown

the [[World Tree]] of [[Nebos]]
due to the [[Signa Void]] that dominates the system, there is no central [[Spirit]] of [[Life]]
