a familiar is an anima spirit that Binds to a person with the capacity for [[Language]] and [[Culture]]
Familiars formed from a [[Perpendicular Sign]] are a sort of negative cast of a person [[Sign of the Self]]
When a familiar is first made it is basically a fetus with no agency and no defined shape, but still cognitively reflects the age of the person it was made from. Young Familiars are able to change their shape easily but this diminishes the older the Familiar gets. 

As a familiar grows with its owner, its personality and abilities are entirely dependent on the person. It is a reflection of a person and all of its attributes, physically, mentally, and personality. A familiar is unable to regulate or mask the emotional bond so will display the emotions of its person through appropriate body language. Familiars will change overtime as their person does, both physically and mentally. They can be deliberately changed shape on command although this requires energy and [[Signa]] to do so
- are used to manage bindings, consume harmful spirits (magic immune system?), and navigate the [[Complex Plane]].
- Spirits can form Familiars if they are able to bind to a [[Sign of the Self]], this often happens with a [[Deity]]
- can interact with the [[Sprite Microbiome]]
