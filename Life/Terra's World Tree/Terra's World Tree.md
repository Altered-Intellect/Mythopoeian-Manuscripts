the [[[[World Tree of [[[[Terra
The world tree of the Terran system is one of the largest world trees in the known universe because of the concentration of [[[[Signa in the system, and the sheer size of the planet within the [[[[Complex Plane, with the highest recorded variation in Signa density and biodiversity. 

The tree has branches for both its carbon and silicon [[[[Life. the carbon branch has no elemental branches other than carbon-phosphorus, but the silicon branch has two, silicon-magnesium, rubidium, and sulfur. Life initially arose from the silicon branch but was soon out competed for space by the carbon branch as the planet cooled. Despite this, due to its interactions with the magic system, silicon life survives deep within the mantel of the planet and has given birth to many branches of [[[[Possessor Spirit the most notable of which is [[[[Demon(s).
# [[[[Realm

# [[[[World Scar
because of the collision with [[[[Theia, [[[[Terra has a large world scar, the roots of its world tree anchor around, unable to gain purchase on the world altering event itself, but its impact has a major influence on the shape of the world tree.
# [[[[Spirit
(Type)
Spirits of [[[[Terra will change based on what they were created out of (the spirit of the forest can be ‘burnt down’). Spirits that are formed around an ecosystem will look like the organism from different animals and the properties of the thing they represent, but can literally look like anything.
manifest to living things as illusions, giving the being the sensory input without physically affecting anything unless it is [[Bound to it in some way. Spirits takes the form of similar things to what their system contains but repeated, amalgamated and fractalized 
Spirit of the river will appear as a river bank when projecting from far away and a torrential flood when close
## [[[[Nature Spirit
(N/P) (Kingdom)
A spirit that forms from different biomes, ecologies, and geographies that make up the planet. Most are bound to the geography of the planet and its geographic cycles or “spheres”. There is a family of nature spirits that represents each. The hydrosphere, biosphere, geosphere etc.
- Spirits of nature have less ridged, more abstract and are less predicable boundaries then spirit made from constructed or semantic systems, due to the properties and restrictions of language. They have no Anatomy instead their structure is based on perception and its interaction with the environment
- are more animistic, appearing as their local flora or fauna
## [[[[Sprite
(Kingdom)
Spirits that form from the chemical and electrical processes of living and nonliving systems,
Sprites are the spirit equivalent of a cross between a fungus, a plant and a bacteria. Without emotions they enter a state in their life cycle as tiny spore/cyst-like seeds that are basically anywhere there is life and a what to get spirit matter. They feed and/or structure themselves off of simple or elementary changes in a system. active a passive modes correlating to cycles of growth and decay in organisms 
**[[[[Sprite Microbiome**
an organism has several colonies of sprites that inhabit their body, but unlike a gut microbiome they can interact more easily between individuals and have more prominent cycles of activity and rest
Once a colony of sprites is established they can encourage their host to provide them with more information to bind to. Feeling produces sprites which produce more feelings, this cycle is either disrupted by the mind, gut, or a constraint in resources 
- form symbiotic relationships with [[[[Spirit(s)
- the spirit analog to the ecology of microbiomes in living systems and environments, are apart of the [[[[Sprite Microbiome
- sprites exist in all ecosystem and in all corners of the planet as their cyst form can survive any environment that has enough complexity and [[[[Signa. 
### [[Cognition Sprite]]
(Family)
take the form of repeating patterns
the most complex variant of sprites that use the structure of cognition and thought in their life cycle
#### [[Focus Sprite]]
(Class)
take the form of spiraling gradient from the area of focus outward
use mental concentration and consciousness as the structure for its biology
#### [[Dream Sprite]]

#### [[Amnesia Sprite]]
(Class)
Take the form of chaotic jagged paths that don't overlap
### [[Emotion Sprite]]
(Family)
take the form of substances that clings to the organism producing the emotions
Typically emotional sprites are only able to form from strong emotions. They grow regardless of the perceived strength of the emotions and only when given enough energy
These sprites are unique in that they not only affect the spirit realm, but will leak into the physical affecting the space around their semantic source of structure. despite this, they are still unable to be seen via mundane interactions with light
- the emotions gives the sprite structure as that use it as an anchor for their bindings, but they feed off of Signa like other spirits
- how pleasant the emotion is affects the brightness of the spirit
- sprites will interact with each other to create unique effects for more complex emotions 
- Sprites form different shapes depending on the cultural signs of the person growing them
#### [[Joy Sprite]]
(Class)
take the form of ribbons and strings
#### [[Sadness Sprite]]
(Class)
take the form of webs and tendrils
#### [[Fear Sprite]]
(Class)
take the form of crystal lattices 
- flight and freeze responses often have the sprites growing from the environment, and fight responses have the sprites growing from the organism themselves
#### [[Anger Sprite]]

### [[Reaction Sprite]]
(Class)
take the form of refraction and shapes of light

- The magnetic vines
#### [[Soot sprite]]
(Family)
sprites that form from the chemical reaction of fire, taking the shape of little floating motes of ash that drift from the fuel, often glowing slightly when near the fire, they have very short life span, lasting around 30 seconds at most
#### [[Spark sprite]]
(Species)
sprites that likes to form around large differences in energy, often from heat but can form from movement, gravitational waves and light, the light they reflect from their surroundings is linked to the energy source, meaning they can not be seen most of the time, are only visible in a specific range of energy levels or at extreme energy levels depending on what 
#### [[Growth sprite]]
(Phylum)
sprites that form around emergence and the growth of and construction of systems, often in the accumulation of [[[[Life from living organisms
take form as refracted light collecting and overlapping each other in regular patterns 
#### [[Decay sprites]]
(Phylum)
sprites that form from the entropic decay of systems and its structure that range from [[[[Binding(s) to [[[[Life to chemical bonds
take the form of light dispersing, fading overtime 
## [[Anima]]
(N/A)
a spirit that forms a symbiotic relationship with an organisms [[Soul]], using it as an anchor to a binding. This spirit can be used as their source of [[Signa]], and an external anchor for their [[Binding]](s)
There are three distinct manifestations each dependent on the [[Sign]] that the [[Familiar]] develops around. The mass majority of [[Anima]] grow from the [[Sign of the Self]]

### [[Familiar]]
As familiar is the spirit that results from the soul of a person. They require knowledge on how to use the [[Sign]] of the Self and require skill to create without messing up the process. When standardization of education eventually happens, students in prestigious schools or colleges are taught how to do the procedure and make the familiar themselves, although it is possible to get a spirit animal at any age if another person knows the [[Sign]] and the appropriate procedure. 

## [[Semantic Spirit]]
(N/A)
formed from the social-behavioral structure of a species' cognition
### [[Communication Sprite]]
(Class)
have two variations, one linked to the [[Signifier]], and one linked to the [[Signified]] of a languages sign, these two variations are always found with each other and form a close symbiotic bond that boarders on complete assimilation 
a language has a tie to a place, anchored by a spirit, they are useful for translating between languages, these language spirits have a vocabulary that is linked to the people who speak the language and the subject 
### [[Spirit Mask]]
(S/C) (N/A)
A mask that is held with a special extrusion to fit in the mouth, when they are worn the wearer can not speak so the spirit in the mask does instead, their personalities merge creating a [[Persona]]. Persona's are directly bound to the mask and not the wearer, the spirit is forced to change under the influence of its wearer but exists separately from them. like water in a vase

>What if in a town the only way to get to power is by never wearing a mask by willingly having their front teeth removed. Because they can’t be anonymous and have to take full responsibility, they are seen as more trustworthy. This forces the politicians to use their power in unique ways to get what they want. This would also separate them from the spirits completely, so maybe these politicians need to have an advisor who always wears a mask and can fully personify the spirit masks. Maybe these people are priests or shamans of some kind. 
### [[Collective Spirt]]
forms from behaviors that are only displayed by groups of organisms like boid-movement (flocks, herds, schools etc.), trails (migration, trade routes, gathering trail etc.), conflict (riots, battles, sieges, armies, mobs, etc.), colonies (cities, towns, nests, hives, homes, settlements, etc.) and beliefs (currency, myths, laws, communication )
#### [[Trail Spirit]]
(N/A)
formed from the path a species takes through the world, the more organisms of that species follow a path and the longer the path, the larger the spirits are able to grow
- often form from migrating species 
- have a similar appearance to the species that travels the path
- are worshiped by [[Hominid]](s), [[Draconic]], and [[Cuttlotl]](s) as traveler or merchant gods despite being much simpler than [[#Deities]]
### [[Value Spirit]]
(N/A)
formed from a cultures view of value, the more people value a system, that system will attract value spirits, currencies are the most common but can also form around other signs of value like art, tools, symbols, literature, and various resources
- have the appearance of glittering patches of light 
- symbiotic relationship with [[Desire Sprite
### [[Mob Spirit]]
(N/A)
formed from the the collective behavior of a group of organisms
- have a "sprite-biome" of sprites that consists of [[Anger Sprites, [[Disgust Sprites, and [[Desire Sprites
### [[Home Spirit]]
formed from the cultural concept of a home
- do not have a central form even within the [[Cognitive Plane]]
### [[Language Spirit]]
formed from the language that a culture or species speaks
constructed of [[Communication Sprites]], their structure reflects in the languages properties such as grammar, medium, and vocabulary
### [[Deity
(Phylum)
formed from [[Myth]](s) of a species
A collective spirit that has gotten a group or race of people to worship it. When a spirit manipulates the native to worship it, it is titled a God. A deity is tied to a concept and the people that made them 
Spirits can also form from a group of organisms that conceptualize a larger whole, as concepts are more often than not a description of systems and ideas. These ideas came in the form of intelligent life in the real world. The spirits that were created from these concepts were in time called gods and just like spirits can range in complexity, power and size. These types of spirits are more tangible, often affecting the real world in more ways, interacting with the cultures and the people who worship them, providing gifts and creating myths around them. These god spirits are much more sapient and reflect the biology of the people who believe in that concept. Human concepts have human looking deities. Spirits created from the concepts of a specific sapient species will resemble the species and have more personality. They are also harder to create and usually require the resources of an entire culture to mature into a deity.
- weather phenomenon, biome, concept, or aesthetic (storm at sea, the dessert and the sun, wine and intoxication, pastels and art respectively
-  form a diety takes is whose form develops based on self perception and ego both of themselves and their worshipers
form develops based on the self perception and ego. Many take on extravagant forms and supernatural power beyond the restrictions of mundane biology
Deities that are associated with disabilities or diseases, gain instincts and knowledge related to them

there are gods made from how cultures view reality, and there are Gods that are direct representations of the universes structure, these two types of divinity interact in complex ways
- gods can call upon the forces that they represent to a culture
- the resources of the gods are limitless but their behavior is not, a god can only act like the concept they represent and there are hard lines to what a god can and can not do depending on how the society that is bound to them behaves, that actions of gods are often the actions taken by the majority of the cultural population, the "biology" and inner workings of a god are determined by the people as a collective group and how they view the god, this does not have to take the form of worship but admiration and storytelling are often the purest expressions of focused attention that people can give to concept, a god is a mind made of magic given the body of a society, a spirit inhabiting the thoughts and behaviors people and the relationship they have with each other and the concept itself
- there is always a bigger warlock

#### [[Fates]]
(Species)
Deities that form from the conceptualization of time including the past present and/or future
##### *[[Past]]*
#####  *[[Present]]*
#####  *[[Future]]*
#### [[Nature Deities]]
(Class)
[[#Nature Spirit]] that have gain enough structure and bindings to gain people that remember, respect, or revere the subject that they are bound to. 
##### [[Mother Earth]]
Mother Earth isn't just a metaphor. She is bound to the concept of life itself on the planet. the keeper of [[[[Terra's World Tree 
The entire Terran ecosystem is in fact a sapient whole. The reason have had a rought time with first contact is because Mother Earth is super xenophobic and kills any non-terran life that appears, often through very deadly diseases and viruses. 
Aliens learned this the hard way and are not sure how to handle terrans desperate plea for first contact.
###### [[Forest Spirit]]

##### [[Father of Storms]]
##### [[Keeper of Seas]]

# [[Spirit Bound]]
(Type)
Hybrid species between mundane organisms and spirits who are born with natural biological Signa manipulation, formed spirits as a part of their biology, often metabolism
Domesticated half spirit species are often selectively bred to improve or alter their abilities.
Most sapient species don’t have natural biological spells as the organs needed to operate Signa manipulation often are energy intensive
made when a species of spirit started inhabiting a mundane organism in a symbiotic relationship that then evolved into the type of relationship that organism have with their microbiome and are now are entirely dependent on the relationship
half-spirits can go their whole lives without names, but when they ARE named by someone with a proper [[Signifier]], they go through a transformation that into different race - goblins become hobgoblins,

- a species that can only be observed at a certain light level or light frequency, considered a spirit of the dusk and dawn
- a species that can't be observed directly and can only be seen through memory/remembering it, it is regarded as a crypid
### [[Colonial Spirit Bound]]
(N/P)
(Kingdom)
A half spirit that is made of the collective bodies of multiple mundane organisms
#### [[Rat King]]
(Species)
A colonial half spirit that is made of three or more rats with their tails tied together. Rat kings are formed when a group of rats are confined to a small space and instead of mentally deteriorating due to lack of space, the group binds its [[Cognition]] to a Spirit and starts acting as a single organism, linking their tails together either consciously or by accident. If a rat king lives for long enough and has enough rats, it will start learning and adapting, gaining and losing rats as it moves from place to place. In extreme cases the rat king will grow large enough to learn to imitate speech and will form a personality of its own, often around collecting resources. not truly sapient, but not dumb either
- rat kings break classification a bit as they are also closely related to societal spirits and deities, but due to the subject of their binding, they behave much differently
#### [[Silicate Jelly]]
(Phylum)
A group of diatoms that form a colonial organism by reforming or linking together their frustule, the silicate covering that they use to protect themselves. These colonies have an almost infinite variety in their structure as two identical groups of diatoms will form different structures based on their environment, similar to how no two snowflakes are the same.  
The transformation from a free floating group of diatoms to a silicate jelly is entirely determined by a biological trigger in a certain environment formed after a large algal bloom happens. When the resources start running low, the diatoms will start linking together in a process that is similar to crystallization but is distinguished by the fact the diatoms will move within the structure for it to form properly. 
The new organism is extremely simple, only monitoring and distributing resources such as healthy diatoms and sunlight within itself while ejecting foreign debris. 
The internal variation of diatoms in silicate jellies are only within its silicate shells. This means silicate jellies have no organs, instead having a gradient of functionality that depends on how the silicate jelly forms and shapes of the individual diatoms.
#### [[(?)]]
(Phylum)
A creature that lives in the bottom of the ocean that is comprised of a bunch of bioluminescent jellyfish whose tendrils are linked to the others around it, like a spider web hanging in the ocean. it is a with the connections slowly changing depending on which other particle is closest
### [[Ent]]
half-spirits of plants

**Ent culture**
Ents think of maple syrup as tree blood, 
#### [[Lichen Ent]]
a type of colonial half-spirit made of symbiotic relationship between a moss and a mushroom that feed and support themselves using rock, they can arrange themselves in a variety of ways
the older a lichen gets, the harder this becomes, some choose to have rock bones like an endoskeleton, some chose to plate themselves in rocks creating a shell or and exoskeleton, 
the muscles are mainly made of the mushroom tissue while the flesh is more mossy, there are three main species that comprise the half-spirit, a class of mushroom subspecies, a class of moss subspecies, a class of plant sprite that that acts as the nucleus of the elemental
### [[Construct]]
(N/A)
an artificial hybrid spirit
Constructs have no agency and reflect how the person treats it. If the person treats the construct as a butler and a servant then that is what it will be, if the person treats it as a companion and a friend then that its behavior will match their expectations. They are quite difficult to make and require constant maintenance. If exposed to an environment that it was not designed to work in, it will be unable to act until given new instructions. If a construct is not given instructions within an amount of time, it will start to fall apart
- basic constructs can not function if not being perceived, so simple constructs are often loud or burn oil to create a distinctive pleasant smell
- if a house has multiple constructs it is common form them to be attached to a system of bells that rings as the constructs move through the house so the servants can keep them constantly running
### [[Homunculi]]
(N/A)
a clone of a person that is inhabited by a spirit, and controlled with bindings
they can not heal themselves as the bindings that make up a homunculus are static, they can not eat, drink or breathe, instead getting energy from the environmental bindings, the binding mechanism can vary depending on the homunculus but often run on heat

### [[Polymorphic]]
(Kingdom)
species that have multiple forms, often with the ability to swap between each using [[[[Dynamic Transformation bindings that are apart of their skeleton
#### [[Werebeast]]
(Phylum)
human or dragon [[#Polymorphic]] that have an animal form 

#### [[Butterfly]]
(Class)
##### [[Illusionist's Butterfly]]
(S/C)
(Species)
can cast an illusion with the pattern on its wings, the illusion is often in the form of an owl or some other bird of prey, different species have different illusions all being predators to scare off things that would eat it, one species evolved to cast an illusion of apes, which have created stories of apes being transformed into butterflies and then later selectively bred to create illusions of humans, it’s caterpillar form can change the color of its skin to blend it with its surroundings

its silk is used to make [[Tapestry silk]]
### [[Goblin]]
(Genus)
half-spirits of households and dens of beings have made, there are many different species and intelligence can range from an insect to a crow which can accomplish basic problem solving. despite their cleverness they generally are dumb
the species that are the most malevolent are seen generally as vermin and unpleasant as they are located in the slums of the uncanny valley, and have the ugliest qualities of pigs, rats and goats. The smarter the species the more humanoid the species is and the more human looking features the species has. Goblins are the most disruptive pests to the sapient races on land  are constantly trying to abuse their progress, causing disease and disruption. depends on the species, ranges from
- make a den in the [[Complex Plane]] use a spatial binding, connecting all of the hidden parts of an inhabited home
- because the genetics of the goblin interact with the home they are bound to, a goblin will look different depending on the type of home and the species the built and inhabit 
- goblins in human dwellings are doglike or furry
- goblins in dragon dwellings are scalie or bird like 

#### [[Hobgoblin]]
Goblins that have been Named by the inhabitants of the dwelling they are bound to
#### [[Solutus Goblin]]
A goblin that has not bound itself to a spirit, 
- increases the likelyhood for disease as the binding supports the immune system
- have odd proportions and are either albino or ultra melanistic 
#### [[Dörgoblin]]
(Species)
a sub species of goblin that live around human settlements and are more likely to live under entrances and steals stuff for their nests
#### [[Kobold]]
a subspecies of goblin that live in or around a dragons den, often forming a symbiotic relationship with the dragons as it accumulates resources for its hoard 

## [[Possessor Spirit]]
(Type)
a classification of spirits that inhabit physical matter through the direct manipulation of Signa and consume energy from said matter to sustain a metabolism and keep it alive
two possessor spirits can not be in the same physical area, if there is overlap, the bindings and signs that make up a spirit will start to interact and the spirits will either get very sick and injured or will die depending on what spirits are overlapping, sometimes this is used in a spirit ecosystem to attack and kill other spirits, or [[[[Solutus Organism(s)
### [[[[Undead]]
(Kingdom)
The undead are a class of organisms within the various ecosystems on the planet that occupy a scavenger-like niche, reusing bodies and the energy and information they contain. An undead is made when a specialized spirit, called a ghoul, possesses a corpse. There are different types of ghouls that specialize in possessing specific species, generalize to live off of any corpse in an area with the right conditions or have formed a symbiotic relationship with other ghouls, or still living creatures like spirits and animals. The behavior and the properties of the ghoul affect how the body decays, how long the spirit can inhabit the body and allow for a wide variety of undead creatures.

undead mostly get the energy for moving around from the rotting of the flesh and breakdown of most carbon structures using the process of [[Autophagy]], this process produces [[Cursed Flesh]]
all ghouls bodies burn and rapidly decay in sunlight, this is because heat and UV light makes the energy extraction process extremely fast and inefficient, expelling any unused energy as heat perpetuating the burn, but if there is not enough heat then the process won’t provide enough energy and the undead will die
This is why vampires are cold to the touch and why zombies like bogs and caves
When a being dies their soul leaves their body forming a [[Ghoul]], a their body and a [[Ghost]]
- the undead can not enter homes because of the caustic interaction between possessor spirits inhabiting the same physical area

- (S/C) cosmic zombies, that tell you existentially horrifying facts about space while they try to eat your brains, the rot that consumes them is entropy itself, leaving a trail of white ash and carbon sand 
#### [[Ghoul]]
(Phylum)
an type of undead creature that gets its energy from rotting flesh, they can range from barely sentient to fully sapient with language and culture
Some species of ghoul are directly born into skeletons which can be reanimated.
many species have symbiotic relationships with the undead, and some which form hybrid species,

 ##### [[Zombie]]
 the first stage in ghouls life, it has no personality and is operating on the animalistic instincts and urges of the dead corpse and is in a semi-living state, they can’t eat or drink anything and without more flesh to decay, usually die off in a week. To survive, zombies are drawn towards the byproducts of decay, become aggressive when exposed to unhygienic scents, and the chemicals released in rotting bodies. this means that zombies form hoards that rapidly form when large amounts of living things die at once, wars are the chief cause of outbreaks of the undead.
 zombie hoards usually burn out quickly but are very dangerous, the result usually produces a very small number of sentient skeletons that can then survive long enough to become sapient

-  It’s incredibly risky to attack undead. The scent of the attacker’s aggressive intent coupled with spilled pungent rotten blood drives other ghouls into a frenzy
- people who live around the undead constantly bathe to avoid being eaten
- ghouls often become docile when adorned with other strong scents, such as flowers and other flora 
- Instead of immediately destroying an undead corpse, cultures often give special funeral rites - the ghoul inhabits the body and is then covered with flowers to keep them calm, and allowed to walk out from the settlement to join a horde.
- ghouls given funeral rites grow flowers within their bodies, eventually bursting from their chest and head area. These ghouls are naturally gentler as the spirits bound to plant life force the Ghoul to reserve it energy and their presence tames other ghouls in the vicinity. Due to their helpfulness, it’s taboo to harm “blooming” undead
- ghouls are so overwhelmed by the scent of rain that entire hordes cease movement until it’s gone.
##### [[Skeletal]]
(Phylum)
a class of undead who have survived long enough to rot all the flesh from the corpse they are bound to, the only way for the undead to keep on living is to find new flesh to rot or decay the bones of the corpse until there is nothing left, eventually starving to death
skeletons are usually gain an odd level of sapience as they have been around longer than most ghouls. the skeletals of [[Hominid]](s) start developing its own mirror cultures that are fragmented through its nomadic life style
travel in bands of 3-5, some of these bands learn to use tools and communicate with each other, 
- they can’t speak though they can be given the ability to do so through spirit binding a [[Pressurepipe]] to the spirit of the skeletal and attaching it to the throat area 
#### [[Vampire]]
(Phylum)(N/P)
undead who use blood as their source of power, these undead keep most of the flesh intact, using a special binding to use the blood for energy, this rots it separating it and coagulating the blood stopping any potential circulation, the mechanisms for their metabolism are spread out through the circulatory system, but are most concentrated in the muscles used to pump the blood, repurposed manipulating the Signa, and the organ used in the creation of blood, repurposed for storing energy
- Tiny vampire bugs that swell up like ticks, they are parasites 
- because the blood stops flowing, the blood vessels in the eyes human vampires break, making them permanently red
- the process of extracting energy from blood doesn't require the host to be dead, but is very sensitive to radiation and heat, so people can get infected by a ghoul, often through exposure to the dead

### [[Demon]]
(Kingdom)
Demons are possessor spirits of destruction, imbalance and chaos
each individual is similar to a colony of or population of individual single celled organisms than a proper multicellular being. despite existing on the macro scale they often display habits of a microscopic being, very fast, eat a lot, reproduce asexually
have gone on the live fast die young route of evolution and just constantly consume things turning it straight in to mass for the nest generation of the colony, all this eating mass makes the creatures emit a lot of heat often catching things that are flammable on fire
most species of demon live in the [[Deeplake]](s), feeding off of the heat and chemicals brought up in volcanic activity
long-lived demons slowly start to gain a limited sapience, a churning mass of bacteria that has over many thousands of years, developed thought
demons are that one dog cancer that is its own single celled disease 
Demons can burn out and freeze if not kept moving, this kills some demons but most return to a cyst like husk that can be resuscitated with intense heat.
- demon exorcism involves lowering the temperature of environment
- because people have strong senses of [[Identity]], and Demons have very low senses of identity. Demons will either actively or passively consume the Identity of a person if the demon knows their [[Name]]
- Because demons are subterranean, most of their ecosystem is under the ocean linking the deep sea to the underworld 
- They are ancient back when Terra was a hot molten mess, the silicate organism stuck around instead of dying out completely, they have changed a lot to become demons but the connection is the same as the rest of life on Terra, just stretching back to the roots
- the colony inhabits the body of its host multiplying like an infection, consuming the cells and replacing them, encouraging cancerous growths so they the body is easier to consume

>A lot of the substances we think of as protection against the supernatural (e.g. salt, silver, garlic) are actually antibacterial, and would have helped stave off infections and illnesses that people once attributed to supernatural influence. demons are repelled by hand sanitizer.
##### [[Ascended Demon]]
(Genus) 
(as opposed to fallen angels), are when a demon gains a [[Soul]] and metabolism becoming a proper multicellular being, developing their true [[Name]], giving them a [[Voice of Structure]], thus sapience
- ascended demons have a body temp that is only slightly higher than most other species on [[Terra]], part of the demon solidify when named giving each individual a unique skeletal structure that can be impossible or impractical in normal biology, this process can be guided to 
- because their sense of self is bound to their [[Name]], ascended demons take nicknames *very* seriously, You can’t call an ascended demon anything EXCEPT their alias unless you know their true name, which also means you have immense power over them. There is no bigger power play than calling an ascended demon by a nickname. It means “I can make you do anything I want”. It’s usually a threat, but there’s also a cultural context for demon using nicknames for loved ones who have chosen to trust them with their true name to say “I can make you do anything I want but we both know you can trust me not to”.
###### [[Oni]]
(Species)
sentient to sapient ascended demons that have been Named by a [[Spirit Binding]], Oni bound by a [[Dominant binding]] are often employed as warriors, guards, or soldiers with varying levels of contentment
- some have spots in similar shapes to bacteria growth in pertridishes due to their previous nature as fast growing colonies of single celled organisms

### [[Angel]]
angels are possessor spirits of static ideals, balance, and order, the corporeal part is a flowering body, the rest is stretched across space-time as the relationship between its [[Ideals]], they "posses" the abstract concept, logic, and structure that is found throughout nature
- they are not the birds but the flock, not the fish but the school, not the mushroom but the fungal network, the bond between a parasitic plant and a forest 
- God's are the third main branch but are above the roots, making demons and their branch of the lifetree older than the gods 
- experience time non linearly 
#### [[Fallen Angel]]
when an angel breaks the [[Ideal]] it represents, losing their [[Name]] and gaining a body, giving it a [[Voice of Silence]] thus conscious experience of linear time
#### [[Nephilim]]

### [[Radiation possessor spirit]]
(Kingdom)(N/P)
#### [[Sky spirit]]
(Phylum)
possessor spirits that use the UV radiation from [[Sol]] as a source of energy, often live in large bodies of water (or tundras?), there bodies are made up of water vapor and airborne photosynthetic bacteria, cast illusions in mirages that paint the clouds
#### [[Reactive Curse]]
(Genus)
possessor spirits that use radioactive materials as their source of energy, integrating the half-life of the material into their metabolism, and life cycle
#### [[Shadow Kin]]
(Genus)
possessor spirits that eats IR radiation, often live near caves with high consistent geothermal activity
### [[Mimic]]
Possessor Spirit that inhabits man-made [[Object]](s) 
#### [[Lesser Mimic]]
#### [[Greater Mimic]]
a mimic that posses entire man made structures such as buildings
