### [[Gaseous Planet]]
planetary bodies that are large made of gaseous materials by volume 
### [[Oceanic Planet]]
planetary bodies that are large made of liquid materials by volume 
- the majority of Oceanic Planets are Hycean
#### [[Hycean Planet]] 
Oceanic bodies whose liquid content is mostly water
### [[Rocky Planet]]
planetary bodies that are large made of solid materials by volume 
### [[Dark Star]]
black holes that have consumed [[Signa]] giving it an oscillation within the [[Complex Plane]] allowing it to interact with [[Binding]](s). this interaction changes the shape and size of the ergosphere, and decreases the size of the event horizon
- as black holes rotate space time, this rotation has bizarre effects on entropy and emergence, speeding up both processes(?) allowing the stable formations of [[Temporal Ring]]
