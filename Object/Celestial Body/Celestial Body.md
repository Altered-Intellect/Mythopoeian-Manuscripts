# [[Stellar Body]]
a [[Celestial Body]] that is large enough to produce light through fusion
all stars have a ratio of matter to Signa in its mass-energy index, the scale goes from zero to ten. zero means the star contains less than a percent of Signa and ten means it is over 99% because of [[Signa]]'s properties of only interacting with itself when unbound, there are celestial bodies that are over 99% Signa by mass-energy content, 
the higher the ratio of Signa, the better the star acts as a hot spot for wormhole formation
- stars with a high density of metals can burn forever, as Signa can reverse fission and keeps the electrical and elemental processes of stars in a cyclical pattern as long as there is energy and Signa input in the form of the [[#Inter-Planar Medium]]
>then the god fell into the endless light of a star

# [[Planetoid]]
a _planetoid_ is a celestial body that: 
1. has sufficient mass to maintain a gravitational hydro-static equilibrium in a spheroid shape
2. does _not_ undergo natural self-sustaining fusion at any point in its existence.
3. generates a magnetic field

# [[Asteroid]]
an asteroid is a celestial body that:
1. is below the mass to maintain a gravitational hydro-static equilibrium in a spheroid shape
2. does _not_ undergo natural self-sustaining fusion at any point in its existence.
3. does not generate a magnetic field
