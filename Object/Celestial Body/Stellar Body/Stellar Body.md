# Nebula
the Signa-matter ratio of a star affects when a star goes supernova, the elemental composition of the star and the properties of the explosion
- metals reduce the radius of the explosion due to the energy transferring properties of [[Signa]] bound metals, and create flowing patterns of electromagnetic flux that interact with themselves behaving like a fluid fractal like in nature
- the more Signa, the more stable the fractals will be 
# [[Signa Star]]
a celestial object made almost entirely out of [[Signa-matter]]
all Signa stars have a connection to each other, the size and shape of that connection varies from picometers to kilometers depending on how close the other Signa stars are and the size of the Signa star
areas of spacetime with a high concentration of Signa that have formed a stable binding through the [[Complex Plane]], these bindings often start out very small, only millimeters wide and over millions of years grow to kilometers to light-years large depending on how much mass-energy the Signa has access to
