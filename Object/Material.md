# [[Metamaterial]]
a material whose properties are determined by the intersection of two or more bindings
# [[Somatic]]
materials of biology
### [[Telenacre]] 
a meta-material that is use to manipulate space-time, linking sections of it in place, increasing or decreasing the passage of time without producing large gravitational fields
### [[Explosive Marrow]]
can be purified into a substance similar to gunpowder, made from the bones of [Creature/plant]

### [[Cursed Flesh]]
a foul smelling muck that is composed of ash, water, and bacteria from a corpse decomposed by [Biological Binding] (s) from an [[Undead]]
### [[Steelgrain]]
or grained steel, is a wood harvested and treated from the trees of the [[Ironwood]]

## [[Blood]]
>a system of organs in communication, defense, and connection, that internal ocean we brought from the seas
- mammalian - hemoglobin : contains iron, is often burgundy or bright red depending on it oxygenation, hemoglobin is contained within cells
- celephalopd, arachnine, carcinian - hemocyan: contains copper, is blue or clear depending on oxygenation, hemocycan is not contained within cells and is instead free floating
- crocodile ice fish - None : colorless, oxygen is dissolved directly into the blood
- Insect blood is dark brown and looks dark yellow when in low concentrations
- draconic blood : 
- leeches and blood suckers - clorocruorin : green due to the large quantities of biliverdin, a byproduct of hemogoblin decomposition
- some lampshells - memerythrin : ranges from purple to brown depending on oxygenation and concentration, bonds more strongly to oxygen, used in low oxygen environments
### [[Worm blood]] 
can be a powerful hallucinogenic that can allow metalborn to see through walls, its also can draw out [bronze group](copper, zink, nickle) metals from the blood which can be either dangerous or helpful depending on the species
## [[Excretion]]

### [[Tapestry silk]]
a type of silk that comes from the cocoons of [Illutionist's Butterfly], the silk has the properties has the ability to retain information of the light and around it, when information is put into the silk it gains tiny indentations that stores the information of that light, this acts as a sort of holographic etching encoding images, this can be read and interpreted, because of these properties the silk can retain information from [[Prophetic binding] (s)
valued for its ability to absorb the pattern of the light around it, making it able to display images of the things around it or store patterns of light from some other source 


## [[Artificial]]
Material made by an organism, either externally via tool manipulation, or tangentially through interactions with it environment
### [[Shadow film]] 
A thin cloth material made from a type of sign-bound [[#Tapestry silk]] that can deflect light in any direction, the cloth is bound to a material that has high [Signa Conductivity] that allows control over the angle and polarity of the deflected light 
Shadow film is used in the first projected movie films
### [[Combustion Clay]]
A family of clays that can store chemical reactions and vary in degradation and efficiency on release. The storing if the energy tempers the clay into ceramics that release their reaction on breaking. The surface of the break releases the reaction. These ceramics degrade over time slowly releasing the stored energy as heat light and high signa debris
### [[Liquid sharpening]] 
a material that primes any self-repeating structure to grow given the proper material and energy
### [[Blue-Purple brick]]
a type of stone that both resists and reflects the effects of the Signa-dense currents of the [[Pearlsand Sea]]
### [[Optic Glass]]
a material  made from a molecule derived from [Tapestry silk] with unique lightbending properties
### [[Guffin Gold]]
also called fools gold, its a variation of pyrite that turns anything its plated on into a macguffin to anyone who senses it; it's hard to obtain because it is nearly invisible, only reflecting a small amount of yellow-white light on its surface
### [[Liar’s Gold]]
A alloy of pyrite that is extremely convincing as a substitute for gold
### [[Null-grain]] 
(N/P)
“no-purpose flour”, a chalky dust made from [Corrupt grain], it can’t be burned, mixed, or combined with anything. The only way to get rid of it reliably is by burial at a [[Life Well]]. it is sometimes used to decrease the potency of Signa dense mulch so the crops wont mutate
- decays into ash and stone after a couple hundred years
### [[Blister steel]]
a Signa-steel alloy that includes oxygen in its structure, is used to absorb energy from explosives, highly unstable, decays into rust, steel, and smoke
### [[Gate opener]]
one of the sought after holy grails of alchemy, a base Signa liquid that can be used to create any structure of binding from an input of pure energy and entropy, declared impossible to create until two centuries after its proposal, created by a linguist that took to studying its form 
>it ever hidden from the eyes of alchemists

### [[Alchemic Material]] 
compound that have bindings contributing to their structure

### [[Alloy]]
- there is an infinite amount of Alloys that fall into a fine set of types
#### [[Metametal]]
an alloy that contains a [[Signa-matter]] metal 

##### [[Quicksilver]] 
(translates to living or moving metal), a special alloy of metals that allows a large amount of bindings to form in the alloy, giving it complex properties, the bindings are affected by the shape of the metal, with higher surface areas making it much easier for the bindings to change,
a braid of living metal

##### [[Stillmetal]]
a [[Metametal]] that has a [[Complex Temp]] allowing it to keep a set temperature without getting warmer or colder 

##### [[Subzero alloy]]
a [[Metametal]] that has a negative temperature : it absorbs heat without warming up, instead transferring the energy into [Axi]

### [[Signa Crystal]]
A crystal that forms when the concentration of Signa in a material is high enough that the Signa changes the energy levels of atoms, allowing bonds between the molecules to be as strong as the bonds between the individual atoms. This forms a uniform lattice in most materials similar to a metal alloy or a crystal. The most common type is formed from Sodium and Chlorine, but can form from several salts, metals, and silicates 
#### [[Phase Crystal]]
doped [[Signa Crystal]](s) that when given energy convert all matter it comes in contact with to a phase (solid, liquid, gas, plasma, Bose-Eisenstein condensate etc.) consuming as much energy and entropy it needs to accomplish it. These crystals are used in everything from engines to alchemical processes.
- can be used as heat sinks, chilling water to freezing temperatures
- be used as energy generation inputting energy from a novel source and turning it into rotational power by boiling water
##### [[Elemental Phase manipulator]]
when the crystals are doped with [[Alchemic Material]] (s) to make them only phase change a specific element or element group on the periodic table, this changes the energy transfer efficiency for different elements
- used in furnaces to heat and alloy metal
- heating and cooling substances to precise temperatures, often in processes that create [[Alchemic Material]](s)
### [[Lightweave]]
photons as physical force, electromagnetism made physical 
aka "hard-light"
when light interacts with energetic bindings, it creates physical forces that are linked to the properties of light, specifically how it interacts with itself, beams of light act as physical objects
the wavelength of light will create a force that interacts with matter or molecules at that size/Radiation moves molecules or particles depending on the wavelength
#### [[Lightweave Cloth]]
a cloth material that is made of woven chains of Signa, and photons, it can pass through itself and most non metallic matter depending on the wavelength of light the specific structure of lightweave used
used as an advanced method to locate metal ore in stone, machines that weave light through mountains to pinpoint the location of ore veins, [Dwarves] hate this method as it has a habit of collapsing caves and killing wildlife in them if not done properly
### [[Voidweave]]
spacetime as a physical force, pure negative mass-energy
aka "dark-matter" 
it bends light around it, creating a space where no light can escape 
- Creature made of or with voidweave will implode or collapse when killed as atmosphere fills the empty space
### [[Wormwood]]
a wood made from weaving the leaves of [Wormgrass] into a desired shape, then dried and cured in a [lacer] made from a [family of oils] found in the shallows of the [[Arboreal basin]], the grain of the wood is determined by the types of weaving used in its construction
#### [[Wormgrass Sap]] (N/P) 
the fluids of wormgrass, both the sap and oils, extracted by milling it into a pulp that is then compressed
#### [[Nectar glass]]
an amorphous solid made from [[Wormgrass Sap]], its is made by combining the sap with an [oil] and letting it set for 7 days, it is edible by most species though usually unpleasant to do so, as it is bitter and sharp both literally and figuratively 
## [[Natural]]
### [[Pearlstone]]
a reflective white extremely Signa-dense stone similar to mother of pearl, made when matter is transmuted from the affects of the high concentrations in the [[Pearlsand Sea]], 
#### [[Pearlsand]]
[Pearlstone] that has been worn down into small symmetrical grains by the strong Signa currents that flow through the [[Pearlsand Sea]]

### [[Heedless Stone]]
stone that has high concentrations of [[Silver-group metal]](s) that resist gravitational pull, changes in inertia, and temperature
- most often found within the [[Complex Plane]]
