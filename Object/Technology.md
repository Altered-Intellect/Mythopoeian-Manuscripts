a clay bong filled with [moist] plants, a bong for getting high off of nectar, a colony of [[Growth sprite]](s) live in the water at it bottom, thick with algae, moss, and mushrooms, the ember is encased in amber, needs to be watered and emptied of detritus or else the ecosystem that makes the nectar will die

>My bongwater has developed it's own ecosystem, Legally I cannot change the water now it's federally protected habitat, i just transferred the water to an empty gatorade bottle and i just drop some cracker crumbs in there every once and a while and the bacteria love it. i have heard it refer to me by name before
## [[Bong of Grief]]
glass like flowing mist, a flame contained in thread and wax from a [weepvine](a vine that coats itself in a wax that makes anything that touches becomes numb to most sensations), a stone figure, cursed to weep, rests at its bottom. the tears form from the mist as the horns weigh on its head
- a shrine to catharsis and broken love
- using it makes the user hungry but unable to eat

>The hardest thing about heartbreak is that love never really dies, it just kinda sits there and… starves.
## [[Skeletal's Tavern Speaker]] (N/P)
An anonymous public radio speaker that it's patrons can bind their voice to, popular with the undead, specifically skeletal's because of the ease of access to the speaker

## [[Gravity globe]]
a globe made from [[#Optic Glass]] and a [[Planar binding mechanism]] that is bound to any gravitational field around it, when the globe is rotated, the direction of gravity is aligned with the rotation, the strength of the gravitational field can be controlled using rotations within the [[Complex Plane]], these together give the user control of the gravitational field around them
the lens displays the system with the highest gravitational pull on the globes gravitational manipulation as a volumetric illusion
- on the bottom of its base the words “the world is now in your hands, its placement is key” are engraved
- can be used to make a space ship drive
## [[Storm-glass]]
a vial of liquid set in a wooden or stone base with some measured amount of sand at the bottom, the liquid crystalizes depending on the pressure of the atmosphere allowing the precise prediction of storms
- first iterations simply have a nucleation point, often a bit of silicates, on the bottom and marking on the side to measure, but as they become more precise, the shape of the glass and it volume, and temperature are taken into account and use to measure the atmospheric pressure, direction, intensity, and other properties of the storm 
## [[Stormcaller]]
a device used in boats with bindings to its sea, as a storm rages it sails as if the waves were not there, waves reduced to calm ripples laping at the hull, then radiating out into the storm again, vaguely resembles a clock and sundial that has the ability to predict and to a lesser extent control a storms movement 
- measures the barometric pressure of the atmosphere, the direction of the wind, the average, maximum, and minimum wind speed

a type of device that used the [[Complex plane]] as method to bind itself to a realm
### [[Tellers Ring]]
a ring of strange bronze-like metal with an engraved stone surface on one side and a hole in a planar binding on the other, the hole has a mouth with exposed blackened gums with no lips, wide gray teeth and tusks protruding from it, thick unnaturally dense smoke pours from the mouth, commanding horrors, promising riches and final satisfaction in life all in the name of its freedom 
- it is unnaturally heavy, but far lighter than the [[#Rygoliths|Rygolith]] that contains it 

>"the pale void shattered, smoke and flesh like a gray-yellow river of cancerous death flowed from it" 

## [[Optical tech]]

### [[Bio-Ink]]
developed by the [[Cuttlotl]]
synthetic biology to modify and the epigenome of synthetic organisms giving them their proper shape, in medicine to treat wounds, perform surgeries and drug administration, 
this ink typic ally has microbes suspended in it that can perform a variety of tasks from producing proteins, polymers, DNA, and complex drugs, to creating electromagnetic fields that aid in tissue regeneration 
# [[Heating Element]]

turns electrical current into IR radiation, which in most cases is used for heat
# [[Engine]]s

# [[Tool]]
### [[Indefinite Blade]]
Similar to the subtle knife in the his dark materials series 
Can cut holes in reality to different [[Realm]](s)
To close it the blades edge must be run perpendicular to the cut and pinched closed

### [[Transportation]]
- Flying ships that have parachutes that deploy when the ship is in free fall, and use generators both on the ground and on deck to create lift motion and steering, ground based generators have a limited range so ship routes have chains of generator towers, with some large enough to

### [[Weapon]]
- Spirit sword that can only be grabbed by someone with phantom limb syndrome, the spirit of an ancient powerful sword that can not be wielded directally 
- A sword engraved with the words “Do not draw me without reason. Do not wield me without valor.”
- Weapons that ride the winds, created to form a pressure differential that nears a vacuum making it lighter, only people bound to wind are able to reach through the vacuum and hold the weapon without it boiling the blood. dragons by default are able to hold these weapons but it take more training for them to use it proficiently
- a bell that can weave air like metal, it has two layers with the outer edge curling inwards that harmonize 
#### [[Sword of Great Waters]]
my take on Excalibur, made of bog iron and [[Ironwood]]. Forged by [[Nimueh]], and enchanted by [[Limuah]], which is bound to the nation [[Waterfront]]. Its purpose is to act as a tool and a symbol of power for the chosen bloodline of ambassadors, was made in the "ancient roman" style of the time period which as that point was centuries old. the enchantment of the sword was changed when the sisters fought, the spirit of the nation became unwilling to separate itself to change, both sisters wanted to use the sword to spilt the nation, thus the sword became a paradox which was resolved by it splitting in two 
#### [[Weave-Blade]]
a blade of [[Lightweave]] that can separate any molecular bond, these blades can be [[Symmetrically bound]] to the [[Complex plane]], so that the wielder has control over the shape of the blade (relegated to a 2d plane) and what types of molecular bonds it separates 
- light blades do not collide with each other, and instead interact through deflection, refraction, and reflection, making the fighting mechanics between two light-blades entirely different than normal sword fighting
Lightblade handles are balanced and expand when activated, which use a binding, often mental, connecting to the soul of the wielder, the blade is a bit like an exothermic chemical reaction, needing an initial push of energy but then can be sustained with very little energy
- Weave blades are summoned from a Signa ring that then accumulates light from a power source. Often the [[Realm of Light]] or from a metal that is externally energized by an electromagnetic field

##### [[Lightblade]]
[[#Weave-Blade]] made of [[#Lightweave]]

>Light does not move, Light Is
##### [[Voidblade]]
[[#Weave-Blade]] made of [[#Voidweave]]
#### [[Seed quiver]]
uses a set of bindings containing [[Health]] and [[Growth]] to grow wooden arrows out of seeds the seeds have been cultivated to grow in small balls of mud and clay, and naturally growing into and arrow shape with little concentration
#### [[A slime slinger]]
it uses [[#Slimes]] as ammo and flings very angry slimes that attacks anything it stick to, the wielder can feed different materials and to the slimes to change their behavior, and properties. some of the more deadly ammo for the slinger is a slime that is bound by a set of stone spikes bound to instantly burn up all of their innards and a slime that is naturally acidic and fed an extremely acidic solution to increase its PH
#### [[Plasma Blade]]
uses a very energy-dense crystal to power a special type of chemical laser that acts a bit like a glass blowing torch, the laser passes through a special set of lenses that transforms the light into super-heated virtual particles and gives them laminar flow, creating a blade
these plasma blades need a constant influx of energy as much if it is lost to heat and IR radiation, the power source is usually a portable pack with  an [[Inter-Planar Gate]] reactor that pushes the appropriate amount of power into the system
#### [[Songblade]]
a series of blades of different length set into a sword that vibrates to the natural frequency of the things around it 

>a terrible blade of singing steel
