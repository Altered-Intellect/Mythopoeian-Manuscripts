Galactic Timeline
- T-0 : Formation of the Universe
    very few stars have been created and most of the universe is suspended hydrogen and helium gas 
    - T-100/700 million : The age of steam and humus
     a time within the Mythopoeian Manuscripts that roughly coincides with a period of time in the real world where the average temperature of the universe was in the range for water to be a liquid but happens later and lasts longer due to the slower cooling of the universe
     this era is the origin of life and the bed of soils in which all the trees of life bury their roots, it is the primordial connection that 
     this was not random chance as the signs and spirits that came before it longed to rest and flee from the fires of creation. These primordial spirits used the new signs of the world mantel to keep worlds at optimal temperatures, creating the first garden worlds of interconnected webs of spirits bacteria and fungus 
     most life was living organic compounds and single cellular life that lived in water rich soil that was abundant throughout the universe

# Terran Timeline
- Formation of [[Sol]]
    - Formation of [[#Terra (N/P)]] 
    - Gathering of [[Signa]]
        - Passing of (the star) (N/P)
        a Signa star with a [[#Wormholes|wormhole]] passed through the [[#Sol]] system, bringing with it a newly travelling interstellar culture
        they decide to scrape off of the top of the highly bound ecosystem in the spirit realm for study, transporting it to a terraformed planet in their system on the other side. They also planted biology within the system, notably introducing a bunch of alien species to [[#Theia]], several trojans of [[#Terra (N/P)]], and many of the moons of the gas giants in the system, populating them with [[#Void Ecology]] from their system, just in case.
        - Era of silence
        the 250 million years after the formation of multicellular life, then its migration onto land
        - First age of Dragons
        Hundreds of millions of years ago dragon developed their niche in the ecosystem and slowly started spreading across the continent they evolved on
        A few hundred thousand years pass and dragons now cover all of the main continent
        - Second age of dragons
		About 50 million years later a species of dragon who was smarter than the other wiped out the competing species giving dragons the social intelligence of birds like crows and the problem solving of early hominids.
		In the next couple million years dragon spread to every other continent and start adapting to the environments they spread to slowly getting smarter through competition
		- First age of man
		Humans and all of their relatives evolve, and rapidly develop intelligence through infighting
		
		Dragons develop communication with each other but its is still not a language but a system of noises to communicate basic ideas, similar to the way birds communicate with each other
		Humans develop tools and start using them on each other, this is also when dragons start to master magic and using their developed verbal magic to compete with the humans tools
		About 50,000 years B.W. humans wipe out their relatives like in real life and like the dragons and develop language and begin hopping continents
		Humans migrate to reach every corner of the planet and start using and stealing the resources (metals, gems, and food) that dragons have been hoarding for centuries, this pressures the dragons to develop their communication into an actual language, this in turn forces humans to be nomadic as dragons are able to coordinate and attack settlements, humans start to learn to control mana from tradition and observing the dragons
		Humans first started killing old dragons, using tools and tactics to strike at the right time and from far enough away, it was for the fact that they hoarded materials. This was at first liked by the dragons because it distributed wealth back to other dragons because the old dragons had a ridiculous amount of wealth and the humans would often leave behind most of the resources. But this cycle snow balled and one dragon killed turned into twenty as humans used the resources they stole, killing and stealing from dragons quickly becomes a popular but reckless job
		Human technology starts to advance quickly and humans start to discover how to generate energy using mana, then storing it in salt water, and an explosion progress happens when a group of scholar creates a system for manipulating mana with greater precision.
		Humans quickly create a giant empire and drive out the dragon population out of a large portion of the continent and capturing the rest, using them as slaves, this empire dominates the world for a couple of hundred years before collapsing under its own weight
		The split empire war against each other and both sides fight each other to exhaustion, this allows for a dragon rebellion to rise up and destroy the last remains of the empire and with stolen weapons magically nuke the humans back into the stone ages by creating a spell with the help of some captured humans to wipe all magic from humanity
		- First Dragon-Human War
		the dragons establish their own empire that is split into tribes that are made up of different races of dragons with slightly differing biology
        - Terran Semantics Age 
        discovery of complex bindings, such as [[Enchantment]], [[Contractual]] and [[Dominion]] spirit bindings, and many of the components of the [[Metasign]](s)
        - Terran Space age 
        the space age has furries, through the discovery of [[Chimeric manipulation]]
