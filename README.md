# Mythopoeian-Manuscripts
worldbuilding bible and plot outlines for a personal project that I have been working on and off for the past ~5yrs
focuses on a scifi fantasy setting with a very in depth magic system based off of real world semiosis, well known tropes and my own research into various topic 
stories center complex premises based off of adaptations of popular narratives and the carzy ideas that i come up with from the worldbuilding
this is an obsidian vault so the intended reading expirence is within the obsidian markdown editor which allows you to click between documents via links like a wiki
everything here is free to use as long as it is adaptive and/or transformative in nature and you send me a what you have made, i'd like to see it!
thanks for reading and i hope you enjoy it as much as i did to create it!
