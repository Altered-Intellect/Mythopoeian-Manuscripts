- A party diner where the dress code is “that one outfit you never have any chance to wear.”
- A joint restaurant and stripper club called kebabes where both meat and sexy strippers elegantly rotate on poles
- there's a store in my town that closed about a year ago, when you look in the window there's nothing in there but a half full bottle of pepsi smack dab in the middle of the floor at night a light is always on and it just illuminates the bottle so fucking ominously. I've come to the conclusion it's being used as bait for something
- Hotel Harbera 
- Library of Sextants

#### [Scorpion den]
formed by dragons living in the massive sandy desert and crowding around the biggest oasis in the desert because there is nothing to control around the oasis. Some dragons control the territory around it and build structures out there, most of which are consumed by the sand. This crowding forces dragons into an incredibly small area by dragon standards, making dragons live so close kicks their territorial instincts in the nuts. This turns the scorpion den into a vile pit of thieves and crime with most dragons becoming unhinged, angry, or depressed at the lack of space, they have adapted to this but the instinct is still there. The scorpion den is controlled by a single family that regulates the water in the den and recruits powerful dragons to enforce their control. named after the scorpions whose venom can instantly kill a full grown adult dragon, but only stun humans

#### [The Great Lake]
The great lake is the kingdom and domain [[Nimueh]]. The capital of the Great Lake is an artificial structure that was constructed over the lifetime of the kingdom and is a representation of its progress. It is a marvel of engineering with part of it above water, and the rest submerged. There are also many minor cities dotting the shores. Given the [[Nimueh]]’s obsession with progress and profit, she has a trading deal with many countries around her, and more that she reaches by sending ships down the river to trade with. The kingdom has many schools and trade houses focused on increasing the efficiency of transportation, and providing services to its people.
In the lady of the lakes nation all the rich people own expensive trains, the symbolism is right there
#### [The Great River(s)]
The Great Rivers are the two rivers feeding into and going out of the Great Lake. They are the Kingdom and domain of [[Limuah]]. When she heard her sister planned to demolish the waterfalls, she made her capitol in the biggest waterfall, and proceeded to build cities, towns, and even outposts in the rest. In the river strips between the waterfalls, she has transportation and trade on a small scale going on, with the waterfalls being stopping points. The sisters came to an agreement that [[Limuah]] could use the lower river to reach the ocean for trade, and [[Nimueh]] could use the Lake to get between the upper and lower rivers.

#### [Soltown]
A villa town started by the Kingsmen family, known for their best sun grown fruit, nicknamed the Sun-nook. As more people moved in it was changed to Suntown, the town is constantly fought over by both nations trying to steal the ownership of the town through law passing, the paperwork for this poor town is a mile deep. Most of the people don’t think of themselves as a part of either the Lake empire or the River federation. The town originally sprouted from the many battles that took place in that area during the first water deity conflicts. Profiting off of wartime sales, the fledgling town experienced an economic boom that temporarily made it a central point of the war. Once the war ceased though and the town became a disputed territory, the town’s prosperity quickly atrophied. Now in the present time of the story, it is little more than two neighborhoods separated by the main road which cots throw the town.

The well is extremely deep and no one has seen the bottom of it, and the water came from a lake far deeper underground
#### The Corpse Isle (N/P)
The small continent that the dragons inhabit has a small island shaped like a dragon off of its coast because the leader of the dragon rebellion wanted to become a giant kaiju monster, he messed up the spell and died from overheating almost instantly and over time turned into an island in the shape of a dragon, spawning a whole host of weird ecosystems

- there is an old airship that uses a special book of levitation detailing what part of the airship the book is affecting and a bunch of other things and a backup generator pumping energy into it to keep it floating, most of the airship is ripped to shreds and the reason the characters come across it is that the generator that is keeping the airship up broke, overclocked the magic book, sending the whole airship to the upper atmosphere. The generator though is now running out of fuel and the airship is slowly drifting to the ground, the characters that explore this abandoned airship describe it as smelling like burnt metal despite everything looking perfectly fine albeit a bit washed out.
###### [Dirtmouth]

#### [The dark forest]
the largest arboreal basin on tera
A vast section of the arboreal basin inhabited by impossibly huge trees with bark torn and flayed from the wood, thick dangerous undergrowth, and web-like vines everywhere, the biodiversity of this place is beautiful, dark, and extremely high, the understory is shrouded in endless night, and there’s nasty carnivorous plants swampy mud and quicksand everywhere.

There is a black sand beach at the end of a dense jungle. The air is humid, and a dark dense fog covers everything. It's in the middle of the night and dark clouds fill the sky. everything is dark, the sea a roiling navy, the trees in the jungle a dark deep green, the clouds and the sky are every shade of grey. everything is warm, the sea is so warm that it is producing the warm fog and the jungle retains it, keeping the air as still as possible. 

A fog-covered open market on the way to the center of the city-state, strange stuff that is for sale, most of it weird fruits and food but some are Bound objects. The city gradually gets denser, and more chaotic. The buildings were made of stone and covered in clay with wooden beams as roofs and balconies.

##### [Old Arbor]
the oldest travelled path on [[Terra]] 
The holloway that leads through the dark forest is the deepest in the world reaching the stone bedrock below the forest, few travelers use the path, yet it still becomes deeper every year, the trees bend into the holloway keeping the crevasse from collapsing, the roots extending down into along the walls forcing them from filling the space and twisting into the stone itself, the path seems somehow more ancient than the forest it runs through despite its environment of hostile isolation. Sustained by a very ancient but very simple spirit that feeds off of the complex tapestry of life in the dark forest to deepen its path
