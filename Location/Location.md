# [[Cosmic Weave]]
our universe is describes as a web of galactic super-clusters, in this universe, the shape of this web is more regular and has sections that behave similarly to fractal like waves, retaining an irregular structure
- the shape of the weave is due to the electromagnetic interactions between matter and the [[#Inter-Planar Medium]] affecting the macro scale structures of the universe 
- the expansion of the universe happens at a slower but more consistent rate, mainly due to the ability for matter and energy to travel freely through spacetime via the [[Inter-Planar Medium]]
## [[Galaxy]]
high Signa galaxies are much smaller and spin much faster

### [[Galactic Arm]]

### [[Galactic Sector]]
#### [[Crucible of the Cosmos]]
a place in the galaxy where most stars are reborn and mega structures are forged, many solar systems and home worlds orbit this place as it is a center of intra-galaxic trade, migration, and technological power

# [[Rouge System]]
Celestial systems without a central star
## [[Casio]]
### [[Seliton]]
the large [[Gaseous Planet]] that is the center of the system
#### [[Chorodía]]
3.48 G
the largest orbiting body of [[Seliton]], home-world of the [[anemone crayfish]] they live underneath the global ocean covered in ice, it is a rouge planet in a relatively small elliptical orbit around a star cluster
- The cultures of Current revere light as a sort of spiritual force, and electromagnetism as a divine force separate but connected to the more “mundane” forces like heat, matter, gravity, and bindings, They define electromagnetism slightly differently and put more emphasis on its interactions with Signa
- cultures view change as a natural property of existence, light, which moves at the speed of causality is seen as unnatural, exotic, and strange
#### [[Mother Moon]]
the largest orbiting body around [[Chorodía]]
# [[Stellar System]]

A trinary [[Signa Star]] [[Stellar System]] with each with high levels of [[Signa]] where life was seeded on this planet many times as life makes it way through the wormhole in the center of the trinary system this planet transporting pre-prehistoric species from across the galaxy, it is the most genetically diverse place in the universe
## [[Stellar Atmosphere]]
medium of Intra-stellar material mostly consisting of charged particles, electromagnetic fields, and atomic debris. these form dynamic weather that interacts with the bodies that orbits the stars and the [[Inter-Planar Medium]]
## [[Spectrum-house]]
A collection of plants from different planets covering the whole spectrum of light, they are from different parts of the universe, each one has a unique shape and reflects a very specific wavelength of light, the collection has thousands of plants, each plant is housed within cubic meter of space genetically engineered to fit in the space given, each wall of the space emits light the plant can use but is transparent to the specific frequency that the plant reflects.

## [[Insiuos]]
### [[Vetar]]
.67 G
the world of twin lands of stone and ice 
an eyeball planet with its sunward side mostly covered in mountains desserts, and the nightward side covered in oceans blanketed by ice 
Kamen
### [[Nightsea]]
the hemisphere of [Stone] that faces away from its star
- Hexagon rocks on continental scale
### [[Stormwall]]
the eternal storm that separates the [[#Nightward]] side from the [[#Starward]] side
#### [[Shadowland]]
the area before the [Stormwall] on the [Starward] side
### [[Starpeak]]
the hemisphere of [Stone] that faces its star

#### [[Amoebic sea]]
oddly colored body of liquid which is made up of 50% or more biological matter, often in the form of microscopic organisms, these often exist under oceans or seas, forming off of the dead biological matter that falls to the bottom of them, these seas are also often extremely salty and can be analogous to brine pools, these pools are often extremely dark as most light is absorbed or scattered by the living organisms - 
## [[High star]]
### [[Avantris]]
1.05 G
World of ten thousand suns, the garden under the Kaleidoscope sky.
A world's with a Dyson sphere like structure around the planet that is well beyond the frost line but is warmed by thousands of large mirrors that reflect the suns lights onto its surface
A celestial body settled by several [[Hominid]] species when a [[Signa Star]] passes through the [[#Sol]] system several thousand years before space faring cultures start to arise from [[Terra]]. When this starts to happen humans are the first to get to the planet. The people of Valley where transported by an alien species scout mission searching for life on other worlds, they decide to transplant some of the human cultures, they are unaware of the many other species cultures because of their own biases The planet has a seven segmented super-continent, with each with a wide variety of cultures, each nation has its own divine strain of grain. The type of grain is what defines the society, monetary values, and trade and how the inhabitants gain their abilities like luck, prosperity, destruction etc. the people call this world Humus or "new soil"
the planet is also very volcanically active, giving the planet seven continental plates, each lined with their own ring of fire
The planet also has six moons, only four of which are available to the naked eye, the other two are far enough away to need telescopes, humans have found the fourth moon and have kept this information through their post transplant collapse along with a bunch of other ancient scientific discoveries, rescued by a religion founded from the practices of the [Cult of All Knowledge(N/P)]. the fifth moon has yet to be discovered by the native human population
There are certain parts of the planet that have a more varied mineral and element content so pieces of the planet will be pushed in a certain direction giving rise to crazy impossible-looking structures like floating islands, valleys that go miles under the sea level, land trenches, and staircase-like canyons that run deep underground and into the sky. Caves containing minerals or diverse matter content have odd shapes, sometimes being perfectly curved, flat, or patterned walls (depending on the material) have floating crystals, energy structures, complex forces, or mind-bending structures, these are uncommon and are dispersed throughout the planet's crust.
This world doesn't have is highly radioactive elements as they decay extremely fast, Coal and oil doesn’t exist on this planet so even though humans were sufficiently advanced, the industrial revolution never happened, there was a magic replacement but the emperor of the human empire was so obsessed with keeping it a secret that it was never used outside of the emperors chambers
- astronomy becomes a forbidden practice, astrophysics is a form a heresy, trying to comprehend the divine is seen as trying to become divine 
- the whole planet is a terraforming project by an interstellar culture made up of several species from the system 
- the planet is divided up in to several sections 
- The planet has many tiny moons making the tide harder to predict, moons are used as sky-hooks, refueling stations, mining stations, and bases
- The planet has a super-continent like pangea, which is dominated by a central valley
- The humans have similar traits and behavior to a native species that they have myths about 
- native humans use the expression “by the fourth wind/moon”
- Synl Yrun Geml Hys'iv, the four gods of the winds
- Thermal Lake: a lake with geothermal activity below it that has geothermal vents that produces a Signa-dense gaseous fog that is heavier and as nearly as dense as water, creating an "atmosphere" underneath the lake
- the continent is known as the valley by the hominids and "the land" by the natives
#### [[Oceanic Plain]]
a biome on this planet that is essentially a giant super-deep valley that has similar properties to the open ocean, stuff like pressure differences, light levels, and distribution of life. features like ravines, brine pits, continental shelves, hydrothermal vents, and kelp forest
#### Notos - West wind(N/P)
first and second largest of the moons around [[Avantris]]
Zapad
#### Zephyrus - East wind (N/P)
second and second smallest of the moons around [[Avantris]]
Istok
#### Eurus - South wind (N/P)
third and second smallest of the moons around [[Avantris]]
Jug
#### Boreas - North wind (N/P)
forth and third largest of the moons around [[Avantris]]
Sever
#### Needle
fifth and smallest of the moons around [[Avantris]]
Igla
#### Rose
sixth and largest of the moons around [[Avantris]]
Rouz
#### [[Highest Sea]]
A sea in space, in the creation myth for a world, a god strikes a rock creating a crack in it that pours water out of it to give the people a fresh warm spring, the people do something stupid and the god throws the rock into orbit in anger where it creates a sea in the sky. Bonus gods have a habit of throwing things into the sky, guess where they all end up
## [[Urans Wheel]]
2.22 G
homeworld of the [[Ptequinerodactyl]]
land of shimmering clouds, winds like tides and mountains that gouge rifts in the sky
Toиak
## [[Harinth]] (N/P)
k class star, Signa matter ratio of 0.00002534, low enough to be considered in a [[Signa Void]], named [Absence] by many of the cultures outside of the system
this body is unique because it, and most of the bodies in its system, are completely devoid of [[Signa]] but still has the properties to develop and sustain life
the star has the highest concentration of [[Signa]] in the system because of its mass, but due to its heavy interaction with both [[Electromagnetism]]
named by the [[High Glider]](s)
### [[Ferrous]]
2.64 G
known as the "red earth" by the the sapient cultures of [[Nebos]], and the Iron body by others made mostly of iron, carbon, and silicon, it is the blown out core of a supernova that drifted as a rogue body for a couple of million years before settling into an orbit around another star, through its high magneticity 
lighter elements where blown off by galactic wind (or extracted by a an interstellar civilization? maybe they planted some drones to monitor the system?)

#### [[Nebos]]
.98 G
known as "The Sea" by most of that inhabit the body, orbiting [[Ferrous]], it is more similar to Earth than Terra, it has more surface water (around 82%) and has a stronger magnetic field and more active tectonic cycle, [[Nebos]]' composition is almost identical to earth is only slightly less massive, within a percent. 
the life that inhabit this planet haven't evolved to interact with [[Signa]] and thus are unable to perform sign manipulation through biological mechanisms, but are still able to use signs and develop a second voice
as they are integrated within the galactic society, refer to themselves as "supernatural snubs"

## [[Sol]] 
K class star, Signa-matter ratio of 9.23, high enough for it to be considered a failed [[Signa Star]]
### [[Terra]]
1.42 G
>Terrans, children of [[Gaia]]. The most feared of the Celestial Pantheon

this planet has a similar amount of water content to earth, but only 66% of the surface is covered in oceans as most of the water is held within ice caps, the large continent spanning ecosystems like the [[Arboreal basin]](s) and within the crust of the planet, and the ecosystem of the [[Deeplakes]].
the planet is a living system, with life affecting the planet as much as the planet affects life,
Coal and oil does not exist in significant amounts on this planet so even though the [[Hominid]] species (and later the develop similar principals that led to the industrial revolution, the progress is not powered by fossil fuels but rather advances in [[Signa manipulation]]
in the wider realms of the interstellar community, all life from [[Terra]] is perceived as extreme, dangerous, strange or most often a combination of the three. the planet has 1.42 times the gravity of earth and has very chaotic weather patterns due to how the magic system interacts with the atmosphere and the various other bodies in the solar system. the tides are also unpredictable due to the giant rings the equally giant moon has. the planets ecosystems cover every inch of the planet, from the super Signa saturated [[Pearlsand Sea]](s) to the poles of the planet that are home to [[Blue-ice Glacier]](s) that fall hundreds of degrees below zero. not to mention the [[Arboreal basin]](s) that fill entire valleys with overgrowth and millions of species that can and will kill you. and yet people insist on building cities on or near each one, think fantasy deathworld that the first aliens had no idea how to approach yet alone classify.
- because of [[Sol]]'s high [[Signa-mass]] ratio, the Solar winds contain information contained within hyperbolic wormhole at its center, allowing bridges to be formed across worlds 
- Terra's Aurora is strong enough to bridge between all three [[Realm]](s)
- the deeper into Terra you go the more perception is warped as more and more stone 

#### [[Theia]]
>"she is the moon and I am her rings" - a line from a poem in [[The snail and the heart-shaped fungus]]
##### [[Moonwild]]
an area under the rings of the moon that at a much lower elevation and has a biosphere of bioluminescent lichen-grass and kelp like trees that make a thin forest, this giant low elevation area is sheltered from the light of the sun and allows for lakes of ice to form at the very bottom of the craters, these craters and lava tubes also hold ice from comets that have hit the moon, creating a water cycle that powers the organisms that live in them 
ice falls from the rings at semi regular intervals and disperses many of the lichen species
the ecosystem has and active water cycle, with water going from a solid to a gas and back again, the steam forming a medium that spores and seeds can disperse through 
- exists partially in the complex plane as lower elevation has pooled [[Signa]] over many hundreds of thousands of years
- intersection between [[#Terra's World Tree]] and [[Valley's World Tree]]


# [[Natural]] 
### [[Pearlsand Sea]]
>"Signa shimmered like a mirage persisting beyond its optical limitations."

Vast valleys of desolate land at the lowest places on the planet, overwhelmed with high energy Signa, meaning almost nothing can live in it as it will mutate and die, only the most Signa and heat resistance species can survive the warping heat of the magical fields of the desert
the high energy Signa mutates things, melting and burning them into plies of gore that then solidify into [[#Pearlstone]], and in the process warping a twisting into spires that stick out of the dunes, the invisible wind weighing on the spires wearing them down into to expanse of [[#Pearlsand]] that the desert is known for.
a giant with a sea of almost pure Signa, invisible to the eye but bleaches the sand white, forms air currents, radiation burns, warps light, massively increases your chance to get high energy Signa-induced mutations or cancer and makes the entire place as hot as an oven. It has a much larger surface area than perimeter because of the increase in Signa and energy, bending some of the space into the [[Complex Plane]]. People often visit this place as it has a dense exotic biosphere and rare resources found no where else
multiple peoples have established small towns along the coast, they are usually not super technologically advanced as the Signa drastically affects electricity making it dangerous. They instead use the currents of Signa directly, harvesting it from the sea and refining it into useful energy. living on the coasts is dangerous as the ground can suddenly increase in temperature 
many parts of the seas exist far into the complex plane, making them impossible to traverse through by normal navigation
- its like a brine pool but for Signa
- many of the buildings built in the Pearlsand seas are made out of [[Blue-Purple brick]] 
## [[Life Well]]
an area with a high concentration of Signa but low concentration of energy
### [[Blue-ice Glacier]]
glaciers of blue ice that have formed over thousands of years
#### [[Berg-shore]]
the glaciers that connect to the oceans and seas near the [[#Blue-ice Glaciers]]
- the ice bergs that break off go through a life cycle of breaking apart and flipping over as they drift along the shores, sometime the bergs rejoin with another glacier on a different shore 

### [[Deeplake]]
large underground reservoirs deep within the crust of the planet 
#### [[Boilingstone basin]]
seas of magma between the more solid rock of the crust, formed from the volcanic activity of the core interacting with the Signa at the surface
#### [[Magnetic meadow]]
a place where fields of iron rich grass sway in the changing magnetic fields of the planets molten core, it is located deep underground near the mantle, located underwater in giant patches of water below the crust of the earth
### [[Arboreal basin]]
forests so large and old that they contain as much water content as a sea, often filling large valleys. the trees get larger the deeper into the valley, there are often thousands of undiscovered species, places, and secrets hidden within them
effectively walk across the sea but the deeper you went, the darker it would be and the animals would get progressively scarier and more dangerous. 
The forest gets so incredibly dense that the trees that die cant fall to the forest floor and instead are infected and reused by the hungry shoots of neighboring trees. the remnants of these dead trees are consumed by the surrounding plants creating a complex maze of roots, trunks, and branches, that is difficult to distinguish each from the other, 
this forest is so huge that it has distinguishable biomes and layers to it ranging from treetops that scrape the sky to root systems that split bedrock
tides are matched to the day night cycle, in the day the leaves of the tree tops extend up in competition with the trees surrounding it, moving large amount of winds into the lower canopy
Coal peat and other byproducts of decay are rare in areas with high signa life as they are often burnt up by [[Spirit]] ecosystem in the area and Bound that use it in their [[Binding]](s)
Arboreal basins are powered by a carbon cycle that reuses energy. This cycle includes bacteria that digest and break down oils, and large carbon molecules 
Trees don't die, they are reborn as clones or offspring of nearby trees. The dead tree is hollowed out by the agressive territorial part of the ecosystem. The wild life feed the carbon cycle and then after it is then infested with hundreds and hundreds of seeds that sprout and compete for dominance, the most successful of which perform gene transfers and either get consumed by the main tree or merge with it
- life time of 100k to 400k years
- Layer of the arboreal basin that is filled with carnivorous plants, most of which are completely black, another that is mainly symbiote that feed off the roots of the great wood trees, most of the plants are stark white because of the lack of chlorophyll. Layer above the cannibal one has plants That are light green on the underside and dark or black on the top to mimic the lighting of the forest around them

#### [[Brush shallow]]
plains that resemble normal forests surrounding most of the [[#Arboreal basin]]
- the "shore" of the basin, often called the "forests shadow" by the cultures that are aware of the depth of the arboreal basins
- there tends to be deposits of coal in the shallows as the carbon cycle is often less efficient or not complete
#### [[Arboreal Abyss]]
The deepest part of an Arboreal basin, completely blocked off from any light. Most species of fungi, and lichen live in the arboreal abyss and many have symbiotic relations with the plant species that live in the deep. Bioluminescence is prevalent but not common as making yourself visible is as much of an advantage as it is a disadvantage. 
- animal, plants and fungi feed of of the sap, leaves, and bark of the higher levels
- has a fungal layer that is stretches from the low light areas to the rooted bedrock feeding on the decaying plant matter of the basin, forming parasitic and symbiotic relationships with the rest of the biosphere

### [[Life Well]]
an area with a high concentration of [[Signa]] with various levels of energy levels, this creates a tapestry of entropy and emergence that life and [[Spirit]](s) can use to feed off of and accelerate their life cycles 
# [[Artificial]]

### [[Megastructure]]
as species and their societies expand into space they start constructing mega structures as it is easier than terraforming planets, it is still done but only as a necessary process of cultivating and transplanting [[World Tree]]s as they become a heavily invested art. This is usually done to planets that need minimal terraforming and a preexisting biomass or conditions for that biomass to thrive in

### [[Oracle well]] (N/P)
a table at the center and a crystal ball placed on top but the oracle has extremely long robes that cover most of the room, wrapping and draping over everything in the small space. The oracle herself is hidden in the shadows, wearing a hood over her face, the cloth has gate patterns on it and pinpoints of light will glow on the cloth mapping the stars in the sky, when the oracle is performing their rituals the cloth is perfectly opaque but it seems to fade in and out of existence especially when you have angered the oracle, each of the flecks of light are from the stars they represent 
	- the room is bound to the [[Cosmic cave]](s)

### [[Holloway]]
A type of forest path that runs through the dense growth of forests, the longer the path has been use the larger and deeper the holloway will be, the largest have stones inlaid into the paths sides to prevent the sides of the path from collapsing, the oldest man made holloway is ten feet underground and is around eight feet wide, the stonewalls on the side of the path are overgrown with lichens, vines and roots, this holloway runs through the densest forest known blocking out almost all sunlight from the path and in some areas the branches of the trees are braided together to prevent water from reaching the paths floor, the paths that have been used for centuries are sacred ground with a few guarded by mythological beast, protectors of the forest, or religious factions.
#### [[Whitevine way]]
a [[Holloway]] made through the shallower parts of the [[Arboreal basin]]
### [[Sword graveyard]]
Are made as they are places where people would retire their swords after they have been broken or have served their use. The most popular way of decommissioning a sword is to have it enshrined or put in a display but that is often expensive so people often just stick it into a gravestone or have it recycled. If a sword can’t afford a proper death it is often put in a dump or put in a mass sword graveyard. Battles often birth graveyards, battle worn swords are seen as cursed if not kept with their wielder, people are usually buried with their sword
### [[Libraritorium]]
a library-lab hybrid where both experiments and its data are stored, its a local space for scientist, researchers to collaborate and conduct experiments and for the rest of society to access the raw data for reference 
often built in universities
### [[River town]]
A community river that instead of being replaced by bath houses, and irrigation is regulated by a dam upriver and sectioned off by how each is used, the waste disposal is the furthest down river, the irrigation is next, then bathing section next followed by the fishing section and the recreation section and then the ritual and spiritual section near the top, as the town grows is goes from frowned upon to illegal to misuse part of the river
#### [[Stream hall]]
halls within cave houses near rivers that allow water to flow along its roof and drip down at specific intervals making a constant stream of music, these evolve to become very elaborate and then transform to have live performance

### [[Villa town]]
towns started by single families often from the resources and trade done by the family business. They are usually established over several generations and are very tight knit communities
### [[Barrack town]] (N/P)
Towns establish on the infrastructure built in the battles between nations,
### [[Prophecy Hall]]
Like libraries, a Prophecy is stored within a dedicated building supplied by taxes. It is common for libraries to have a dedicated prophecy hall or be located near one. The halls are run by oracles, prophets, and seers. (various jobs that involve sorting new prophecies and keep track of the progress of others)
### [[Temples of Trespassing]]
large stone shrines or buildings built underneath bridges, originally built by [[Troll]](s) as apart of their cultural rituals, they leave out sacrifices to the [[#Deities]] of travel and the roads that pass through the bridges 
### [[Cypher vendor]] (N/P)
a type of vendor that is often used in black markets and illegal trade. Instead of carrying their wares around with them they instead hide it in protected but accessible locations and sell the coordinates. Most of these vendors branch off from establishing underground market businesses that want to keep their products that are too difficult to handle, store, or move for a more consistent profit. These vendors become standard when black market raids become popular and frequent.
### [[Public Voicebox]]
a voice box is a device use to communicate with people over large distances like a phone but is used to connect the noises of one household to another, often between families, a public voice box often connects several towns together and has greater range
