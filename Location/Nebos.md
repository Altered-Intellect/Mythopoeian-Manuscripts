Giant iron dais inserted into fine concrete, with a set of iron path insets leading to a semicircle of national flags, 

##### [Wrong-half beach]
a coast of strange happenings. Where the weird comes up from the depths and the unknown beaches its terror. the place on [[Nebos]] with the highest concentration of Signa
pogrešna pola plaže beach or P3 beach
##### [The Truth Office]
a repurposed neutrino detection lab located under a glacier owned by the nations government, documented to research the development of the growing field of biotechnology. Its true goal is tangential to that, focusing research on [[Signa]]s interaction with biology. they design the technology that allows people to manipulate fundamental particles with their mind, The designs were partially made through trial and error calculations by a super computer the have to run at high efficiency this the cold bunker, 
their research is about figuring out the mechanism the prevents the stable formations of [[Signa]] on the planet by studying the small quantities of it that can survive in meteorites rich in salt which are most easily found in arctic poles and deserts
- special care is made to trap their stores of [[Signa]] in special containers so the [[Leviathan]]s in the system cant feed off of it
- the neutrino detection facility used lasers, em fields, and frequency analysis to get their detectors down to absolute zero, this makes neutrino detection orders of magnitude more likely
- the green house for anomalous plants
- used to be run by some very passionate but worn astrophysicists 
##### [Morrico valley]
###### [Morrico]
hometown of [[Conner]] and [[Samantha]], and much of older generation in the local area
##### [The Data site]
the [Government facility]'s sister location, a bunker located in the desert, is used to test dangerous biotech and reality bending tech derived from their unique analogue computation devices that use the most cutting edge scientific thinking with the infinite properties of [[Signa]], particle research from the arctic facilities and a supply Signa gathered from meteorites. the location was chosen because of the already existing collection of meteorites in the area and its range from populated areas. the bunkers purpose is to test entropy new bending tech and a variety of energy collection technologies. the energy collection research is stated to be for the reversal of climate change brought on by the collapse of an ecosystem on one of the islands and a source of green energy from the radiation that hits the planet. the energy research is mostly a cover business to fund their research into cracking the structure of the universe open
- has a very compact, but very high energy particle accelerator

#### [[Nebos' World Tree]]
because of the [[Signa Void]] that prevents stable bindings within the system, Thalasia's world tree isn't a living thing, instead an artificial construct created by the 'sapient species' occasional interactions with Signa and bindings when developing language and technology, these inscriptions are set within the whole structure and are a preserved record of Signa's interaction with Nebos.
- their world tree appears as a plateau of stone, inscribed with the True names and bindings of the people who have bound with Signa
- as the species develops, the plateau of stone becomes a pillar, then to a large tower that extends seemingly endlessly into the [[#Inter-Planar Medium]], and is woven with a sprouting [World Tree] as more and more species start incorporating Signa into their biology, this tower is used as an interstellar port for those travelling to and from [[Signa Star]](s)
