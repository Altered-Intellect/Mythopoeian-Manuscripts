# Concept
the orbiting body of [[Terra]], the long dead remnant of its [[World Scar]]
The moon that orbits [[Terra]]. It is extremely large, around one fourth the mass of [[#Terra (N/P)]], and is the same distance relatively to the planet as the moon is to earth. It has a set of rings that are stabilized by the large mount of [[Signa]] that gets thrown around in the system. The rings of the moon have developed a complex cycle of precession, changing from being perpendicular to the moons orbit to being slanted by about 45 degrees. 
Solar eclipses are incredibly beautiful as the rings polarize and refract some of the light that shines through them, creating rainbows in the shape of the patterned corona of [[Sol]]
the moon is often referred to in the mythologies of several cultures as the eye of an ancient god, gouged out and thrown into the sky to watch over the world

the [Theian Ring System]
- have sections and each has its own sub section change overtime, people measure eras by the amount of rings in each section, i.e. the Era of Five Rings 
- affect how the tide and the water cycle 
- have different names in each culture but similar theming, the inner most rings are the most important
- most of the rings are not fully visible in day light, and usually appear as faint white crescents, at night some of the rings will appear as full circles and other as crescents depending on the composition
- all rings are only fully visible in lunar or solar eclipse
- Outer ring matches the seasons of Terra during different eras
there are several asteroid like objects that orbit around Theia, creating the biggest gaps in the rings
